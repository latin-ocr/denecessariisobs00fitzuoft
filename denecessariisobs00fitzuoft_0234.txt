170 DE SCACCARIO

the money, the sheriff provides those sor the writs, tallies, δια, in
the custody of the Marshal ; see Ι. ν. G, below.

P. 65, 1. 20. Hic in omnem. Translate ‘He against every q
opening of the receipt‚’ i. e. twice a year, ‘provides proper wood
for the tallies os receipt and account, and once in the year,' διε.
See Introduction, p. 42·

l. 26. sacrista maioris ecclesie wintoniensis. The read-
ing of the MSS. has here been disregarded. N.'s reading ‘ West-
monasterium' shows that the MS. from which N. was copied had
not the word in full, but probably read ‘W.' Westminster was
not a maior ecclesia in the sense of either mother or cathedral
church, and our author shows that he was aware of this technical
sense in ΙΙ. xi below, where he uses the term quite correctly.
Besides the statement that the sacristan claimed de antiquo iure is
conclusive. See Introduction, p. 45. The Pipe Rolls do not mention
any of the payments referred to in this passage, but as the Chamber-
lains were bound to make them out of the Treasury without
warrant (see Ι. iii. C) this is not surprising. The Treasurer and
Chamberlains do not account on the Pipe Roll. Madox quotes
(cap. xxiv. ξ 14. p. 742) a payment of three shillings for ink for
a whole year, from the Receipt Roll of 9 Henry 111, but it does not
appear to whom it was made.

1. 30. inferius: in the lower Exchequer.

Ρ. 66, l. 3. asserunt enim. A considerable guard was some-
times sent with treasure. Cf. P. R. 5 Hen. II. Hants, p. 45 ‘Et
decern militibus qui conduxerunt thesaurum Regis, fi53 The
king was abroad this year besieging Toulouse, and the treasure
was probably conveyed to France. There is an item in the same
Roll, Southampton, p. 51 ‘Et in passagio thesauri, 125. 30⁷! In
1160 Henry fitz Gerold, a Chamberlain of the Exchequer, accom-
panied the treasure in person, with the Queen and Nicholas
de Sigillo (P. R. 6 Hen. Π, Hanls, p. 47). william Mauduit did
the same in 1166-7 (P. R. 13 Hen. ΙΙ, Southampton, p. 193). In
1158 (P. R. 14 Hen. 11, Southampt0n‚ p. 189) we have a definite
mention of the horses ‘ Et iij. aliis navibus que portaverunt equos
Archidiaconi Cantuariensis et equos camerariorum 4 li. et 1os. per
breve Regis.’ The regular pay of a knight was 8d. a day, as
is shown by various entries of such wages (e. g. P. R. 11 Hen. ΙΙ,
p. 2 ; cf. also Round, Feudal England, pp. 271 sq.).
