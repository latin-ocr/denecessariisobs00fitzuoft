22 INTRODUCTION

represent the treasurer and chamberlains so exactly that they are
even called by their masters’ titles. The actual counting of the
money devolved upon four tellers, whose counting was checked by
the knights. In the reign of Henry III these posts were in the
gift of the Treasurer ¹, on whose behalf the tellers acted.

From the Pipe Rolls of 18-22 Henry ΙΙ, quoted by Madox ²,
it would seem that the office of ‘ clericus thesaurarii ' was then held
by Andrew the Clerk, who had an assistant, Richard. These two
were engaged in moving treasure⁸ from place to place with the
help of Otes of Falaise, Waleran of Cricklade and Richard of
Windsor. Of these three it may be suggested that Waleran of
Cricklade is the deputy of Warin Fitz-Henry, and in that case
Otes of Falaise will be the deputy of William Mauduit. Richard
of Windsor is presumably the pesour or miles argentarius of the
Dialogus.

There are two officers of the Treasury staff who occupy a
peculiar position. They are not attached either to the upper or
lower Exchequer ⁴, are independent of any other official, and
probably date from the time when there was a Treasury and no
Exchequer. They only appear in connexion with the blanching
of payments and, being laymen, hold their offices like the other
laymen by serjeanty and directly from the king. These are the
pesour⁵‚ already mentioned, and the melter. Their functions are
so closely connected with the monetary system, that they may be
left to be discussed under that head.

Of these two serjeanties that of the pesour may be conjecturally
traced back to Domesday. The manor of Broadwindsor in
Dorset is there placed under the head of ‘ Terra servientum Regis,'
and was held by Hunger, son of Odinus ⁶. This family acquired
the manors of Herbert the Chamberlain at ‘ Larode ' and Soberton
in Hampshire, and held all three by this serjeanty at a later date ⁷.
Madox traces the office from 4 John to 48 Henry 111, when it was
conveyed to Adam de Stratton by way of mortgage ⁸.

We do not know what lands were held by the serjeanty of
