NOTES 203

est terra per viros discretos' suggests that the author of the
Dialogus held the same view, though he seems to stop at the
division into hundreds. But the division and assessment date
from an unknown period of history.

P. 109, l. 7. Comes autem est. Cf. Inst. Cnult' (apud Hearne,
Text. Rcff. p. 45) ‘ Comitis rectitudines secundum Anglos istae sunt
communes cum rege: tertius denarius in villis vbi mercatum
conuenerit et in castigatione latronum; et comitales villas quae
pertinent ad comitatum eius et consuetudines liberalium hominum
duppliciter omnes habere,y &c. Before the conquest this rule is
said to have held good only in the Dane-law (Liebermann, Inst. Cn.
Tr. R0y.H1·st. Soc. 1893 pp. 86, 99). It will be noted that the
Inst. Cnuti(dated by Liebermann c. 1110) speaks of the third
penny of market-towns and the third penny of judicial profits as
both falling to the earl. The Dialogus only mentions the third
penny of the judicial profits. See on this point J. H. Round,
Geqffrey de Mandeville‚ p. 287. As to the comital manors mentioned
above see Eyton, Domesday Studz'es. somerset. London 1880; and
J. H. Round, Feudal England‚ p. 114.

1. 13. porro vicecomes dieitur. The history of the name
‘vicecomes’ belongs to Frankish history. There is no reason to
suppose that normally in England the ‘vicecomes' was ever the
officer of the ‘comes' (though special conditions might make
him so, as in Cornwall, Chester‚ Durham‚ and other cases), and
‘ Vicecomes’ is simply the official translation of ‘ Sheriff.'

l. 16. Numquid ex singulis. The emphasis is on the word
‘singulis’ ς ‘are there‚’ says the scholar, ‘in every county earls
who receive these profits?’ ‘ No‚’ answers the master, ‘only these
men (not as Selden ‘these earls’) receive them, whom the royal
bounty . . . creates earls‚ and to whom by reason of that dignity it
decrees that these sums are to be granted, whether in fee or for
lifes The construction is, of course, difficult ; ‘ quibus ’ seems to
be put for ‘ quos' because of ‘ conferenda ' in the latter part; but
the meaning is clear. There is not an earl in every county: but
when there is an earl, he gets the third penny ‘ ratione dignitatis‚¹
whether he is an earl in fee or only for life. This is not the view
of the passage taken by Selden (Tilles qf Honour (1672) p. 523),
who has, however, been misled by a misquotation of it by
Camden, which he has curiously treated as independent testimony.
Mr. J. H. Round (Geqffrey de Mandcvz'lle, p. 293) takes Selden's
