INTRODUC‘rroN 43

sar as it affects the question of the origin of the complete Exchequer.
In the case of the staff, it has been shown that the officers of the
Treasury show most signs of a pre-Conquest origin. The monetary
system, which is closely bound up with that staff, also leads back to
the same era. On the other hand, the arithmetic of the Exchequer‚
like the main portion of the staff of the upper Exchequer, is clearly
of foreign origin. As to the dates, or even the process by which
these different elements were united, nothing precise can be said3
but on general grounds it may be affirmed that the most likely
period for the formation of the Exchequer in its finished shape is
the reign of Henry 1¹.

The Dialogus affords but little evidence as to the usual place of
session of the Exchequer court during the reign of Henry ΙΙ. The
scene of the treatise is laid upon the banks of the Thames, but
there is no evidence to show whether the window² where the
master and scholar talked was in westminster, in the Tower‚ or in
the New Temple, all places for which claims might be put forward.
We have³ in one place a sort of geography of the house of the
Exchequer, where it is explained that there must be a private
chamber for council adjoining the actual house or room where the
Exchequer is held. But the passage does not suggest that any real
building is described, and in fact reads like an account of the kind
of place that must be provided for the court to sit in. There is no
passage in the whole treatise which assigns a definite place to any
of the court's officers mentioned. Two places, indeed, are named
(London and winchester⁴) as places where the lower Exchequer
might be found. And if the passage relating to the tellers⁵ is
pressed, it tends to show that the usual place of sitting was Win-
chester, and that the presence of the Exchequer in London was less
frequent 3 and to this conclusion we should probably come upon
the evidence of that passage. In the second part, however, we find
in the writ of summons ⁶ a passage where the author might naturally
have mentioned some place as the usual one where the sheriff would
have to attend. But the words ibi vel ibi obviously show that he
regarded it as quite possible that the Exchequer might sit in any
town in England. And this is confirmed by the passage⁷ which
