18 INTRODUCTION

the subordinate officers mentioned in this department, some are
only household servants ; but among them occurs William Mauduit,
who received 14d. a day, and seems to have been permanent only
duty, and certain Chamberlains who received 2s. a day and served
in rotation. There is also a ‘ Tallator Regis: who receives his food
and 3}d. a day for his man; and a Chamberlain without salary‚
who receives his food only. There is no clear line drawn between
the officers concerned with Household duties and those who kept
the privy purse, and it is noteworthy that the Treasurer and
Chamberlain appear to rank as colleagues.

Before comparing this establishment with that of the Exchequer
of Henry ΙΙ it is necessary to consider its members a little more
closely. It may be fairly assumed that the ‘ Magister Camerarius ’
was Aubrey de Ver, to whom the office was granted in fee by
Henry I in succession to Robert Malet1. In 1130 we find him
with Richard Basset acting as sheriff in eleven counties—Cambridge,
Huntingdon, Surrey, Essex, Herts, Northampton, Leicester‚ Nor-
folk, Suffolk, Buckingham, and Bedford. We do not as yet
find him acting as treasurer or receiving money in the ‘Camera
Curie ².' The latter office appears to be performed by William
Mauduit ³. The ‘ Tallator Regis ' may be the Godefridus Tallator
who resided in Winchester 4, or the Robertus Tallator who had a
woodman at Eling ⁵, in the New Forest.

It was from the staff of the Camera6 that the principal members
of the Exchequer court were drawn, but the fact that the Exchequer
was both a place for the receipt and payment of money and a court
of account introduces additional complications. The Officers of
the Camera are not divided between these two functions, but each
officer has his seat in the Court and is represented at the Receipt
by a deputy. The chief officer of the Camera—if it is proper to
call him so—who sits in the Exchequer is the Treasurer ⁷. His
duties in the upper Exchequer are to receive the accounts of the
sheriffs and to dictate the words of the Pipe Roll. He himself

⁶ The word ‘ Camera “ is here used for the department of which the Treasurer
and Chamberlain are equally the head. The treasury being fixed while the
Curia is perambulatory, we cannot expect to find the whole department
described in the ⁴ Constitutio,’ but only that part which closely attends the
haga-aloga, 1. v. B, Q, R.
