INTRODUCTION 47

a five-foot table it is impossible to suppose that more than three
persons can sit3 and it is therefore necessary to suppose that the
remaining persons ¹ sat on the bench but not at the table. It may
be noted that the Bishop of Winchester is a newly introduced
official, and that probably before his appearance the Justiciar and
the Chancellor had more room. It will be seen that the size of the
table affords ample room in front of the various officials for them to
work without trenching upon the domain of the calculator. The
sheriff may appear to be cut a little short, but it must be remembered
that the »ΕῙοροο column was not employed in taking a sheriff's
account, and the §.1900 must have been very rarely employed.

The squared part of the table is drawn to show the actual
domain of the calculator. The seven columns are mentioned in
the Dzkzlogus23 we have suggested four rows as the utmost reach
of his arm. It is, however, probable that the squared eloth
extended all over the table.

We may now turn to the actual proceedings of the court. At
the close of each session the preliminary steps in preparation for
the next have to be taken. The Treasurer’s clerks extract
from the roll of the Exchequer just closed all debts still re-
maining in charge. The Barons meet (presumably in the
Exchequer Chamber) and decide how much is to be called
up on each of these accounts at the coming session, taking
each county separately. The rolls of the Justices in Eyre are
produced, and the sums there recorded as due to the king are
assessed in like manner. A summons is drawn up addressed to
the sheriff of each county, urgently requiring him to appear at the
Easter or Michaelmas Exchequer, as the case may be, with his farm
and with the sums thus determined. At Easter he must pay the
half on account, at Michaelmas the whole sum is demanded of
him ³. Besides the debts expressed in the summons the sheriff is
to account for casual profits accruing t'o the Crown. The
summonses are written by the Chancellor⁷s scribe ⁴, sealed with
the Great Seal of the Exehequer⁵ and given to the marshal ⁶, who
delivers them to the usher of the upper Exchequer ⁷, who is
responsible for delivering thern.

¹ The chamberlains, the marshal, and the constable had all of them duties
which require them to rise at any moment. For this reason they probably

did not sit at the table.
