’ 168 DE SCACCARIO

c. vii), but apart from the difficulty of explaining the passage if
this sense is here taken, the occurrence of the phrase deputat
scrzpto just above seems decisive against this interpretation. If we
compare the appointment of the Treasurer's clerk given in Madox,
H. E. xxiv. ξ 12. p. 738, we shall notice that the expression
there is tallias scribit, i. e. writes on the tallies the amounts and
particulars of each; cf. Hall, Receipt Roll 31 Hen. 1, p. iii
and ‘ facta annotatione’ (Ι. ν. K. below). Probably therefore
inbreuiat here simply is equivalent to scribit.

P. 62, l. 24. circumcingitur . . . apponitur. ‘Each chest has
round it a fixed strap, on which on the top, when the locks are
closed, the seal of the treasurer is placed.' In order, therefore, to
open the chest it was necessary to have the two keys, and the
assent of the Treasurer to the breaking of the seals by which the
two ends of the fixed strap were fastened together. At a later
date the strap went out of fashion, and a third lock was used
sor the Treasurer ; cf. Palgrave, Kalendars and Inventories (gf the
Exchequer, Ι. passim, and the frontispiece to Hall's Antiquities

Ρ. 63, 1. 1. Et nota . . . sustinent. This passage has
been bracketed for the following reasons· It is not proper to the
argument, and breaks the sense in a confusing manner 3 moreover
it is in direct contradiction to the account given below, I. vii. D, E.
Of the total inaccuracy of the view put forward in it there can be little
doubt. For instance Sussex pays its farm by tale, but a reference
to Domesday, Ι, 26 a, will show that there-was a mint at Lewes.
The date of the passage is probably subsequent to that of the
main treatise, but only by a few years. The allusion to vna moneta
must be referred to the recoinage of 1180; but on the other
hand the passage need not be later than the death of Henry II,
cf. the references to the king below, II. ii. D, F. It is very
doubtful whether any of the statements here made are of any
authority.

1. 5. monetarios. The moneyers. The system of coinage
found in operation at the time of Domesday, and inherited from·
Old English times (cf. Leges Athelstam', i. 14. § 1. 2. [Thorpe
p. 88])‚ was that in certain towns moneyers were allowed to
work who coined money of the legal weight and fineness, ob-
taining the dies from the king’s officers (Domesday, Ι. f. 179 a).
This system remained in operation till 1180, when the issue of
