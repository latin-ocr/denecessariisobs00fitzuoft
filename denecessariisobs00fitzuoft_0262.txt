offender. It is therefore analogous to the communis assisa, from
which the barons of the Exchequer are also free. The sums of
2s. or 1s. must not be pressed ς they are only by way of example.
The entries of the payments on the Pipe Roll show that the com—
munis assisa was fixed for the county and distributed‘ per hidas. Cf.
Pipe Roll 15 Henry II, where several instanees of communis assisa
occur. The sums vary from 40 to 400 marks; and the payment
is an amercement upon the whole county. See also above I. viii.

be found in Mr. G. J. Turner's Select Pleas (ff the Forest (Selden
Society), pp. lxxv—lxxxvii.

l. 2. imminente visitatione nemorum. It seems pro-
bable that this incident took place in 1 166-7 (13 Henry ΙΙ) since it
appears on the Pipe Roll of that year that Alan de Nevill held
pleas of the forest throughout England, and a considerable portion
of the roll is taken up with amercements made on that occasion.
In this year the Earl of Leicester is mentioned repeatedly in the
Pleas qf llze Forest as having pardons per breue Regis, as are
various other persons connected with the Exchequer, including the
Treasurer (presumably Richard Fitz Neal) for Froxfield in Wilt-
shire, the bishop of Ely, the Archdeacon of Poitiers (but this case
is doubtful), Humfrey de Bohun (who paid relief in this year and
was presumably Constable)‚ John the Marshal, Alan de Nevill him-
self, William Mauduit and Henry Fitz Gerald the Chamberlains,
Ralph Fitz Stephen, and some others whose connexion with the
Exchequer is uncertain. A note to the schedule of combustions
attached to the Chancellor's Roll of the same year mentions that
‘ Ricardus de Neuilla est niger et malus homo.’ His name suggests
that he was one of the Alanz'z‘ of whose extortions the Earl of
Leicester complained. The objection of the barons applied to the
productz'on of the writ ς probably every one of them had charters
of exemptions for their lands, from waste and regard of the
