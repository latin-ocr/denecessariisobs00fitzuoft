defectu. In thesauro iiis. et debet xxxviiii-3 The payments of
the current year are the ‘ noua placita ’ and follow the ‘ placita’ or
arrears.

P. 142, l. 4. Placita autem : the distinction here drawn is that
‘ placita ' are penalfies, ‘ conuentiones ' voluntary payments made to
the King to secure some advantage. But there are many payments
that lie upon the border line; the peculiar position of relief is dealt
with in ΙΙ. xxiv, below; and it may be added that it would be
difficult to say whether a fine for leave to compromise a suit was a
penalty or a voluntary payment, were it not that the payment of
Queen‘s gold upon such fines puts it among the ‘ sponte oblata!
The same difficulty occurs in the case of fines arising from amerce-
ments. See Madox, H. E. xi.-xiv.

l. 5. Oblata spontanea. These are discussed in chapter
xxiii below.

l. 6. tune primum. Up to this point the Treasurer has
conducted the sheriff’s examination (cf. 11. iv. E above), while the
Chancellor's clerk has been checking the account by the roll of the
last year (cf. Ι. vi. C above). That roll must evidently be the
Chancellor’s Roll of the previous year, since the Treasurer and his
scribe necessarily have the Pipe Roll of tha year between them
(ΙΙ. iv. E), while the Chancellor's clerk sits two places further down
and so cannot look over the same roll. The summons is handed
to the Chancellor's clerk by the sheriff (Ι. vi. C above).

l. 12. sieut diximus: i. e. ΙΙ. ix. A above.

1. 29. per firmam: for the ‘coercio’ cf. above II. i. C ‘vel
capientur de firma tua.’

l. 34. Ad vicecomitem. The sheriff accounts for the pay-
ments assessed on counties or hundreds (communia), and in these
cases he gets the quittance or is charged with the debt 3 in the case
of payments assessed on individuals (singulorum) the sheriff is only
(solum) responsible for enforcing payment, and so does not get the
quittance or incur any charge for the debt. For the writ to the
sheriff to coerce debtors see Madox, x. ξ 1 1 (p. 243) note y.

P. 143, l. 11. Erit re vera. No reason is here assigned for
the use of the phrase ‘per breue regis’ instead of ‘per cartam
regis.' In Ι. viii. H above it is explained that in certain cases
this phrase irnplies that the persons having the liberty were not
expected to appear at the Exchequer with their charters to claim
exemption. This is clearly not the case here (cartam ad scaccarium
