Exchequer‚ to supply his colleagues’ lack of experience¹ and to
correct such as held incorrect² views. The following brief sketch
of his career is only intended to illustrate his qualifications for the
task. He was bom before 1133 ³. In 1143 and again in 1145 he
was a prisoner in Stephen's hands as a hostage for his father.
There is ground to suppose that four years after the accession of
Henry ΙΙ, in 1158, Nigel of Ely purchased the office of treasurer
for his son ⁴, and it is clear that by 1 160 Richard was in possession
of that office. He cannot thus have been much more than thirty
when he assumed this office, which he held until his death on
September 10, 1198. As to his ecclesiastical career, his father
appointed him Archdeacon of Ely in 1 160, and he administered the
see during his father’s sickness from 1164 to 1169. He became
Canon of St. Paul‘s and Dean of Lincoln before 1184, and in 1186
he was one of the three candidates selected by the chapter for the
vacant see. On Sept. 15, 1 189 the chapter of St. Paul’s elected him
Bishop of London with the king's consent, and he was consecrated
and enthroned on December 31 in that year. Of his political
activity little is recorded. Only once, in 1193, he emerges into
light as adhering⁵ to Hubert Walter in the debate between that
primate and St. Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln. But we know nothing
of his conduct during the reign of Henry ΙΙ. His political
unimportance saved him from any concern in the dispute between
the king and Becket ς and in the later troubles of the reign we only
gather that he stood steadily by the king and administered his
department as well as he could. He is only known to have acted
once as Justice in Eyre, viz. in 1 194 in Essex.

It remains to consider his intellectual equipment. This was
rather that of an educated Churchman than of a profound scholar,
as may be seen by comparing the Dialogus with the works of
John of Salisbury. The language, though somewhat affected in
places, is generally straightforward official Latin, without any trace·
of Classical construction. The literary allusions suggest that the
author had read Priscian (ΙΙ. xxviii. B) and Isidore (Ι. xiii. xiv) in
the course of his ordinary studies. He quotes Horace sreely,
especially the Epzlrtles and the Ars poetica. Virgil and possibly
