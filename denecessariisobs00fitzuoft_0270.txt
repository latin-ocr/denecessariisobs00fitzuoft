206 DE SCACCARIO

vicecomitis’ is a general reference to the latter part of this book,
not to ΙΙ. iii.

P. 113, l. 5. Verum. Cf. 11. x. G. J below, where the items
enumerated are—Chattels of Felons and Fugitives‚ Treasure Trove,
Chattels of usurers dying intestate and other casual profits. In-
stances are quoted by Madox, H. E. x. § 8, pp. 237 sq.

l. 10. Noueris autem. The process is as follows. Taking
the great roll of the ending year the treasurer's clcrk makes a roll
of all the debts standing over in each county. This is submitted
to the baronS, and they fix for each debtor the amount to be
demanded from him, considering special circumstances in the
various cases, and checking each entry by reference to the great
roll. The Chancellor's scribe (cf. I. v. V. above) takes the amounts
so fixed and draws up the summonses in the form given. As to
the fixing of the amount to be collected, cf. ΙΙ. ii. B. below, ‘ sicut
presidentibus visum fuerit.’ ·

above that this must have been the scribe of the Chancellor's Roll,
or ‘ Scriptor Cancellarie.'

l. 23. Η. rex Anglorum. The form of the summons
continued much the same in later times. Under Edward II it
follows the form of the Dzzzlogus‚ substituting ‘ coram Baronibus de
scaccario' for ‘ad scaccarium‚' ‘omnia' for ‘nominatim,' and
omitting the clause ‘Et haec . . . de firma tua.’ This last alteration
is due to the fact that the items not derived from the previous Pipe
Roll were now demanded by a separate summons called the
‘Summons of the Green Wax,' which appears to have taken
the place of separate estreats sent direct to the Sheriff by the
Justices in Eyre. This course was no doubt due to the rapidity
with which the Summons of the Pipe increased in length. (Cf.
Madox, H. E. Χ. ξ 11, pp. 242-3 3 xxiii. ξ 26, p. 7065 Scargill—Bird‚
Handbook, pp. 322—325.)

l. 31. minores quique perambulantium iudicum rotuli.
Two such rolls have been printed by the Pipe Roll Society (vol.
14) as Rolls of the King's Court, Nos. ΙΙ and III. In the former
of these, cases of amercement and of murder-fine have been noted
on the margin, and the ple-as of the Crown in each hundred con-
clude with an account of payments of aid. As appears both
from the roll and from ΙΙ. Χ. below, the. functions of a Justice in
Eyre were as much fiscal as judicial. He was as much concerned
