examines the sheriff as to the ‘Corpus Comitatus‚’ just as the
Chancellor’s clerk examines him as to the estreats¹. He is per-
sonally responsible both for all that is done in the upper Exchequer
and for the receipts and payments in the Exchequer of Receipt‚
where he has his deputy. But this responsibility is shared in both
branches of the Exchequer by the two Chamberlains‚ who are the
Treasurer’s close colleagues ². Their persona] duties in the upper
Exchequer do not seem to extend beyond sharing the Treasurer’s
responsibility. They also have their deputies in the Receipt.

The remaining officer of this department in the upper Exchequer
is the subordinate of the Chamberlains, the clerk or serjeant who
produces the counterfoils of the tallies issued in the Receipt and
cuts new tallies‚ or alters the old ones as the accounts of the
sheriffs may demand. It will be seen that as the writing of the
roll is the peculias duty of the Treasurer, who was a clerk‚ so
the cutting of the tallies devolves on the Chamberlains, who were
lay barons; and the same division of labour will be found in the
Receipt.

A consideration of the persons who occupied these posts in
the reigns of Henry Ι and the earlier part of that οἱ Henry 11
will illustrate the close connexion between the ‘ Camera Curie' and
this branch of the Court of Exchequer. But before entering upon
the details of this subject a few preliminary difficulties must be
stated. First, the authorities at our disposal do not discriminate
between the Exchequer staffs of England and Normandy 3. A man
may be mentioned simply as Treasurer, and no added word shows
whether he is Treasurer of England or of Normandy. Next the
word ‘chamberlain’ is very loosely used, being sometimes applied
to persons who have clearly no connexion with the Exchequer.
Many of our problems turn upon difficult questions of genealogy,
and, as will appear, there are other stumbling-blocks.

As to the Treasurer: it is not clear who held this office under
Henry Ι. According to William of Malmesbury4, Roger, Bishop
of SaHsbury, combined the duties of Jusficiar, Chancellor‚ and

³ It may even be suggested that under Henry I the two administrations
were not distinct. Note for instance the presence of the two chamberlains
Clinton and Mauduit in Normandy (Pipe Roll 31 Henry Ι. p. 37); and
