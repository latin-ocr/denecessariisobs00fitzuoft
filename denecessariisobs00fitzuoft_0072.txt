42 INTRODUCTION

necessary to observe that no' tally that we have seen seems to be
cut exactly in the way here described.

We may now turn to the actual use of the tally, especially as this
point is nowhere dealt with in the Dialogus. An accountant coming
to make his Easter proffer would pay into the Exchequer a certain
amount of money ; this amount would be recorded upon a tally in
the way described above, and the tally would then be split down
the middle for about three-quarters of its length, and part cut off ;
the soil, or smaller part, was then given to the accountant, and the
stock‚ or larger part ¹, retained in the Exchequer. Beyond this,
another usage arose at an early date. The tally became regarded
as a species of currency. If A had paid fixo into the Exchequer,
receiving a tally for that amount, he might hand his tally over to B,
in whose hands it was equally good sor payment into the Exchequer.
Of course, by this transaction A left himself without defence against
the day of final audit of his account.

We are now in a position to see that, with the aid of the tally
and very simple rolls, the whole business of the Exchequer could
be carried on. The lay accountant and the lay official would
understand the tally system ‚· the clerks of the Treasury would use
the written rolls. The whole business would go on ‘ ad taleas ζ’
without any need of the more complicated arithmetic of the abacus.
It is worth noting that the whole of the work on the tallies is under
the care of laymen, while only the clerical official handles the rolls.

As to the date of the introduction of the abacus, nothing can be
said ³ beyond the fact that the Dialogus tells us that tallies were in
use before the abacus. But it may be suggested that while the
former device is in use in many countries, the latter is a specialized
device only employed by skilled calculators‚ of which the history is
fairly well known from the time of Gerbert. While tallies may
have been in use in England before the Conquest‚ the abacus is not
likely to have been known there; and in consequence we are en-
titled to date its introduction as occurring under the Norman
administration. It is worth noting that the word ‘Scaccarium,'
in the sense of the Court of Accounts, is unknown outside Nor-
mandy‚ England, and countries directly subject to their influence.

The examination of the staff, the monetary system, and the arith·
metic being now concluded, it only remains to formulate the result, so
