8 INTRODUCTION

worn or to have otherwise suffered at the edges. Considering the
practical character of the book, this is not too much to postulate.

Every early MS. of the treatise is entered in a book showing
close connexion with the Exchequer. It may easily be affirmed‚
therefore, that these copies were always made by and for Exchequer
officials. Copies made under such conditions are at once more
and less accurate than others; more accurate because they are
more intelligently made, less accurate because the copyist is anxious
to include all the information in the MS. before him, and will pay
little heed to trivial mistakes and alterations that will not lead
a reader astray in practical use. All the earlier MSS. of the treatise
were probably of the kind here described. At the same time we do
not wish to lay too much stress on our seclusions. The transitions
of the author’s style are often violent and awkward, and his state-
ments are occasionally recklessly incorrect. But we believe that
the passages we have bracketed exhibit these qualities in an eminent
degree, and are for that reason highly suspicions.

Our dealing with the chapter headings rests on a different
ground. The body of the *treatise contains one reference¹ to
a chapter heading, but examination will show that if this is anything
but a gloss, it is a reference to a division of chapters other than
that now existing. Again, the headings differ in R and C, the
only MSS. containing them, and differ also from the contents tables
in the three MSS„ which differ among themselves. Moreover, at
the beginning of Book II there are marked traces of a different
arrangement of the text. Upon such evidence it is difficult to
avoid serious doubt as to the genuineness of the existing divisions.
In order to retain the familiar references to the treatise we have
placed the numbers of the chapters on the margin of the text,
but in our arrangement of paragraphs we have paid no heed to
them. The few emendations we have made are discussed in their
places.

The accepted title of the treatise‚ ‘ Dialogus de Scaccario,' seems
to be due to a misunderstanding of the title-page prefixed by Madox
to his edition, but it has now passed into common use and is con-
venient. The author speaks of his book as being ‘de necessariis
observantiis seaccarii.' Most catalogues of MSS. use this title, and
add to it the information that Gervase of Tilbury is the author.
