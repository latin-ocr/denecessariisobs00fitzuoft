20 INTRODUCTION

Treasurer. In 1130, however, the office of Chancellor was held
by Geoffrey, afterwards Bishop of Durham3 and it is probable that
Geoffrey de Clinton was Treasurer¹ as well as Chamberlain.
The Pipe Roll of 31 Henry 12 mentions him as paying for the
‘ ministerium thesauri Wintonie ’; and he had also³ been engaged
in financial business in Normandy in conjunction with Robert
Mauduit, the other Chamberlain. It might, however, be held that
-Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, remained Treasurer until the date of the
collapse of the administration under Stephen. It is probable, but
by no means certain, that the first Treasurer of Henry ΙΙ was Nigel,
Bishop of E1y3 but from 11684 the Treasurer was Nigel's son
Richard, the author of the Dialogus. The office of Treasurer was not
a serjeanty, and was not connected with the possession of any land 3
but the two Chamberlains were both laymen, and held their
offices as serjeanties. The story of one of these offices can be
traced with some approach to completeness ⁵.

In Domesday we find a certain William Mauduit in possession
of Porchester⁶ and of the manor of Hartley Mauduit in Hamp-
shire. His sen, Robert Mauduit, who presumably inherited these
manors, was one of the Chamberlains⁷ under Henry I. He died
about 1129—30, leaving a daughter and heiress, who was purchased
by William de Pont de I'Arche ⁸, together with her inherited office,
for 1,000 marks. At the same time William also acquired for
himself the ‘ministerium camere curie,' which was probably the
office mentioned in the ‘ Constitutio’ as held by William Mauduit
the younger, brother of Robert. In this way it might have been
supposed that the whole office would have passed into the family
of William de Pont de l'Arche‚ who certainly exercised the office
in 1129-30 ⁹, and continued to hold it until after the accession
of Stephen ¹⁰. But shortly before his accession we find ¹¹ that

him to found the chureh of St. Mary, Kenilworth (Madox, H. E. ΙΙ. 5 8,
