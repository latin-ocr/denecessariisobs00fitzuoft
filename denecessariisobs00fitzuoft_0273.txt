NOTES 209

111 (Ibid. p. 647 n. y.) it is noted that the Sheriff owed >239 5s. 8307.
‘ pro quibus affidauit Marescallo.’

P. 116, 1. 4. satisfaciat. Not necessarily pay, but either pay
or give security as in last note.

1. 12. exceptorum, i. e. extracted from the last Pipe Roll or
elsewhere. Cf. 11. i. Β above.

Ι. 27. quia patens scriptum est. The writ of summons
being sent out open was more exposed to tampering. Accordingly
the rule is laid down that no alteration in it was permissible, and
any error is not to be corrected but obliterated. Even so alteration
was possible, but not alteration to the prejudice of the debtor.
The object of the rule is to prevent the debtor raising objections to
the amount demanded from him by the sheriff. See for methods
of alteration Ι. ν. V note.

P. 117, l. 5. insani capitis argumentum. This may be
a reminiscence of Horace, Α. Ρ. 300 ‘tribus Anticyris caput
insanabile!

l. 8. omnia namque debita. The¹ comparison of the Pipe
Roll of the previous year (cf. ΙΙ. ἰν. Ε below) would show if any of
the old debts had been lest out, while the new debts would be

- shown by the Eyre Rolls or by the ‘ contrabreuia’ from the Curia

(cf. Ι. vi. D above).

l. 16. clericus archidiaconi. This is the only mention
of this clerk in the treatise3 probably he was not a regular
official.

l. 18. Procedente vero tempore. This increase in the
number of the debts was probably due to the fact that any debts
not recovered were put in charge year after year even though there
was no probability of their ever being levied. This is sufficiently
illustrated by the way the Pipe Rolls increased in bulk during the
reign of Henry II. In the twenty-second year it became necessary
to remove the ‘ desperate debts ' from the roll. The same cause led
to the ordinance os 54 Henry III and to the establishment of the
‘Exannual Rolls ' in 12 Edward 1 by the ‘ Statute of Rhyddlan ' (cf.
Madox, Η. Ε. xxiii. ξ 2, pp. 654 sqq.). Another cause which may
have contributed to the abolition of the duplicate summons was the
sudden enlargement of the Pipe Roll in 12 Henry ΙΙ, owing to the
number of convictions under the ‘Assize of Clarendon' (see P. R.
12 Henry ΙΙ, Pipe Roll Society—Introduction).

1. 26. mustris Anglorum rex. Cf. Glanvill, Prologus5
