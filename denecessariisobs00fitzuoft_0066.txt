36 INTRODUCTION

money paymentS. Some of the former still remain, especially
honey payments; but, generally speaking, the firma unius noctis
had been commuted for a money payment. The rents were conse-
quently certain, and payable at a fixed rate in money, or at all
events on a silver basis.

4. Mr. Round has pointed out that the ‘firma comitatus’ was
already in existence in the time of Edward the Confessor ¹. The
farm of Warwiekshhe, for instance, was {65 under Edward, with
a honey rent commuted for 2524 8s. ‚· total, 289 8s. Under
William I it was 22145, and there were other payments ². The
latter farm included ‘pleas of the county,' and thus is strictly
parallel with the farms on the Pipe Rolls.

5. The money used was coined at various provincial mints,
most of the counties coining their own money at the county
towns.

The first Pipe Roll, the only roll remaining of the reign of
Henry I, contains striking evidence of the many changes that must
have taken place between the time of Domesday and the year 1 1 30.
The system of blanch payments is in full operation in addition to
payments made numero and ad pensum ³. Compan'son of this roll
with Domesday suggests, in fact, that what at the first date was an
exceptional thing had then become normal.

There is, moreover, some reason for supposing that in 1130
a transition was taking place at the Exchequer between the period
in which farms were paid ad pensum and the period in which they
were paid, at any rate largely, in blanch money ⁴.

There are also traces of a reorganization of the farms of counties,
particularly in the case of the large group of counties in the hands
of Aubrey de Vere and Richard Basset. There had certainly been
a change since Domesday. Oxfordshire‚ the Domesday farm of
which was §.249 55. 3d. ⁵, with six ‘sextarii’ of honey (worth
about 234), now pays more than fi332 13s. rod. The farm of
Warwicksffire, on the other hand, appears to have fallen to about
>2134 6s. 2d.

³ There is no mention of payments ad scalam. But the existence of this
form of payment is proved by its occurrence in a grant to the church of Holy
Trinity, London, of ζ 25 ad scalam out of the farm of Exeter. The corre-
