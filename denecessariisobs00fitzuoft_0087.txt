INTRODUCTION 53

Treasury both by writ ¹ and without ². Consequently, a Commis-
sion was appointed from time to time to take account of all
receipts and issues of the Treasury ³. On this account it was
necessary to have tallies both for the sums received on account of
blanching ‘¹ and for payments out made without writ. An instance
of this is alluded to in the Pipe Roll of 31 Henry 1, when the Earl
of Gloucester and Brian Fitz·Count took the accounts of the
Treasury of Winchester ὅς and at a later date the Bishop of
Carlisle obtained a charter frorn Henry III that his executors
should not be impeded in carrying out his will by reason of any
such account due from him ⁶. But all this is externa] to the
ordinary Exchequer business, and therefore does not appear on
the Pipe Rolls, which only exhibit the financial relations betwixt the
Treasurer and the accountants ⁷3 and for the same reason it is not
directly treated of in the Dialogus.

Such, in brief, was the system by which the money owing to the
king throughout the country was collected and accounted for. For
further details of its administration we must refer the reader to the
printed Pipe Rolls and to Madox’s Hisl073y of the Exchequer.
