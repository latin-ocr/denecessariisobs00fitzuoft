INTRODUCTION 27

which it is mentioned suggests that it was an accurate copy of
the Pipe and Chancellor's Rolls. In the second passage it is
described in grandiloquent terms as containing ‘iura regni regisque
secreta.' The two descriptions seem incompatible‚ and we do not
see how to reconcile thern.

It has been remarked above that the appointment of Thomas
Brown was a purely personal one; no successor to him is known,
and no trace remains of his roll or of that kept by his clerk in the
lower Exchequer. But there is reason to think that in form and

“ function he is represented in the final form of the Exchequer.

The King's Remembrancer seems, in later times, to have done very
much what he did ; and though there is no clear continuity between
the offices, the great likeness between them is worth noting. In
the same way the functions of the clerk in the lower Exchequer
are at a later date performed by the Auditor of the Receipt. Here
again there is no stated continuity of office, only a similarity in
function.

The statements of the Dialogus ¹ as to the payment of the Ex—
chequer staff are confirmed by the Issue Roll of 9 Henry ΙΙΙ,
quoted by Madox ². It will be observed that these customary pay-
ments are only made while the Exchequer sits, and that the Receipt
cannot therefore be regarded as a permanent department ³, but
merely as a branch of the Court of Exchequer. Further, with the
exception of the Chancellor's scribe, all those who have payments
out of the Treasury are inferior officials of the Treasury staff.
Some of them undoubtedly acted on Exchequer business while the
Exchequer was not sitting ⁴, and in such cases were specially paid
by orders on accountants. The other members of the court pre-
sumably had fixed allowances as members of the Household, payable
by the ‘ Camera Curie,' or else were paid by the persons on whose
behalf they acted. We know at least that under Henry Ι the Chan-
cellor had his 55. a day⁵ while sitting at the Exchequer, but it does
not appear how that salary was normally paid. With regard to
those persons who must have had duties at the Treasury when the
Exchequer was closed, such as the deputy-chamberlains, the usher,
and probably the watchman, it may be suggested that those who
held serjeanties had no other allowance sor their duties at the
