on the hundred; seeondly, that its amount is far smaller than either
the forty-six marks of the lawyers or the estimate of the text.
In 31 Henry I the amounts vary from seven to twenty marks3
in 5 Henry II the amounts are slightly Iower; in 21 Henry ΙΙ
they vary from one to ten marks; and by 1 Richard Ι the fine
is seldom higher than three marks. There is no indication that
any legal payment at any time was made to the kindred. Even
the origin of the institution is doubtful; the Leges Edwardi Con-
fissorz's attributes it to Cnut, and certain passages in the law-
books seem to point to an English or Scandinavian origin. On the
whole, however, we may accept the ‘murder-fine’ of the Pipe
Roll as dating from William Ι, as due from the hundred, and as
. a varying amount which gradually decreased until its complete
abolition by the statute of 14 Edward ΙΙΙ (Stat. 1 c. 4). See
Liebermann‚ Ueber die Leges Edwardi Corgfessorz's p. 1083 Pollock
and Mastland, I-Iz'story of English Law, ΙΙ. 481, 485; Madox,
H. E. c. xiv. ξ 6 (p. 377)‚§ 3 (p. 374). Several cases of ‘ murdrum’
will be found in the Eyre Roll of 6 Ric. Ι (Pipe Roll Soc. 14. pt.
ΙΙ), where the corresponding entries in the Pipe Roll have been
printed (pp. 115 sqq.). One case (p. 98) appears to suggest that
the person murdered must be over fifteen years of age. See also
Chadwyck Healey, Somersetslzz're Pleas, pp. lviij. and lxxvij.

P.99‚ l. 18. Normannus. This must not be pressed; the term
for instance in the Leges Henricz’ Primi is ‘ Francigena ’ ; the Pipe
Roll of 13 Hen. ΙΙ, p. 200, records the payment of the fine for the
murder of ‘ unius Flandrensis.' The term ¹ Francus’ or ‘ Francigena '
is the early term for the French-speaking foreigners William
brought with him among his new subjects the ‘ Angli!

l. 20. argenti examinati. The ‘ murdrum' appears in the
Pipe Rolls of Henry ΙΙ and later kings as being paid numero. In
the Pipe Roll of Henry Ι the sum, in accordance with the language
of the time, is usually expressed in marks of silver‚ The author of
the Dialogus may have argued from this mode of expression that
originally the payment was exacted in assayed silver‚ but he was
probably in error on this point.

l. 34. vix decerni possit. The hundred escaped the
murder-fine if the coroner's jury presented that the deceased was
English; but, as the text points out, proof of this was difficult in
the case of persons of free status
