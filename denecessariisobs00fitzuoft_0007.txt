PREFACE

THE chief object of the three persons concerned in the
present edition of the Dialogus de scaccario has been to
secure an improved text3 and it is with some confidence
on this point that they submit the results of their work
to the criticism of scholars. They have also desired to
collect together the many stray references to the book, and
reduce them to the form of a commentary, adding such
results of their own researches as have seemed to them
to escape the notice of others. No claim for originality
is made by any of the editors for any part of their work.
VVhere they believe themselves to have broken fresh
ground, further research may easily show that Selden or
Mad0x‚ to omit more modern nameS‚ have been before
them3 and though every effort has been made to trace
suggestions to their original authors, it can hardly be hoped
that this has always been accomplished.

The thanks of the editors are specially due to Mr. Hubert
Hall, F .S.A.‚ who handed over to them not only the task
of preparing this edition, but also the list of MSS. which he
had compiled for his own use. They have also to thank
Professor F. York Powell for his kindness in reading the
manuscript and making many suggestions and amendments
therein. Mr. J. P. Gilson of the British Museum has saved
the editors many journeys to the Manuscript room by
undertaking to check suspected misreadings of C. in
Part ΙΙ. Many other obligations have been acknowledged
in their proper places; but the editors wish to express
especial gratitude to the reader of the Clarendon Press.
