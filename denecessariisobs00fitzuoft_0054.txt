Treasury, and that the others were paid either by the persons
whose servants they were, or else by grants of land for life. In
some way or other every one who sat at the Exchequer appears
to have been paid ¹.

In fine, it appears that the Exchequer of Henry II consists of
the ‘ Curia’ imposed upon the ‘ Treasury' as a court of control ;
that the Treasury is the older of the two, and shows signs of pre-
Norman origin.

The Treasury and its staff appear to be the earliest portion of
the Exchequer3 and it may be added that no part of the Treasury
staff seems more primitive than that connected with the farm of the
county and the method of its payment ². As is well known, in the
majority of the English counties the various annual sums due to the
king as the farms of his demesne manors, together with the esti-
mated yield of the ‘ pleas of the county,' were stated as a lump
sum, for which the sheriff was responsible. The total was, as a
rule, payable in weight of assayed silver, and the actual coins paid
in by the sheriff were received at a rate fixed by their weight and
fineness as determined by an assay⁸. No other debts were payable
in this manner at the Exchequer in the reign of Henry ΙΙ, and, so
far as we know, the same holds good of the reign of Henry I 4.

The payment and assaying of the farm was conducted by an
elaborate process, not unlike that of the more modern trial of the
Pyx. Of all this process a full account is given in the Dialogus,
but the author is significantly silent upon two principal points of
interest, where his silence may best be explained as the result of his
ignorance. Inasmuch as he is not likely to have been ignorant of
a process recently introduced, we are entitled to suppose that the
process of blanching the farm of the county was of some antiquity
even in the earlier part of the twelfth century.

The system adopted was, shortly, as follows : The tellers in the
Receipt set aside forty-four shillings by tale for the assay ⁵ in a purse
to which the sheriff set his seal. On the day of the assay this
purse was brought into the upper Exchequer by the pesour (miles
argentarius) ⁶, and a fair sample of the pence was weighed against
a standard pound and counted to see whether there were only 240
