which subsequently accounted numero were Cornwall‚ Cumberland,
Lancaster (the honour, not the county), Northumberland, Rutland,
Shropshire, Sussex ¹. We may accordingly conclude that no
county accounted blanclz unless it contained ancient demesne ².

Now the forms of money payment recorded in Domesday may
be divided into five groups as follows ε

1. Payment by tale — ‘ numerataS‚’ ‘ ad numerum,' or ‘ ad
compotum!

II. Payment by tale of coins of standard weight—‘ de viginti in
ora,’ ‘ad numerum de viginti in ora‚’ and in a single instance, ⁴ ad
pondus de viginti in ora’ (i. e. twenty to the ounce) ³.

III. By weight—‘ pensatas,' ‘ ad pensum,’ ‘ ad pensam,' ‘ ad
pondus,' ‘ ad peis,’ ‘ de . . . oris,’ ‘ curn pensione‚’ ‘ad pensum regis,'
and once (at Tring in Herffordshire, which belonged to Count
Eustace) ‘ ad pensum comitis!

IV. By weight in silver of approved fineness—‘ arsas et pensatas,'
‘ad arsuram et pensum,' ‘ad pensum et arsuram,' ‘ ad pondus et
arsuram,' ‘ad pensam et arsuram,' ‘ curn pondere et arsione‚' ‘ ad
ignem et ad pensum,' together with a group of apparently equivalent
expressions—‘ albas‚' ‘ candidas‚' ‘de firma alba‚' ‘ de albo argento‚'
‘ blancas,' and ‘ blansl

V. By tale in coins of standard weight and fineness—‘ blancas de
viginti in ora‚' ‘ de viginti in ora et albas‚’ ‘ alborum nummorum,'
⁴ de albis nummis,' ‘ candidorum nummorum,' ‘de candidis denariis‚'
‘ de albis denariis‚' ‘ ad numerum de albis denariis!

There are also payments ‘puri argenti’ in Derbyshire‚ and in
various counties in gold. In very many cases, of course, the method
of payment is not specified. In four counties, viz. Middlesex,
Shropshire, Cheshire, and Nottinghamshire, no information as to
payment is supplied, and the only information in Sussex relates
to Bosham.

On preparing a chart to show the distribution of these methods
of payment we obtained little fresh information. The most striking
feature is that the payments in Group V are confined to four coun—
ties, viz. the Isle of Wight, Gloucestershire‚ Herefordshire, and
Cambridgeshire. Of these, all except Herefordshire make payments

⁸ Mr. Rouxi'd (aster ⁸Schmid, Geschz'chte der Angelsaclzsen, ed. 1858) regards
this form as equivalent to payment by tale, quoting the Domesday sum of the
farm for Worcestershire (Victoria History of l'Vorcestershirss p. 243).
