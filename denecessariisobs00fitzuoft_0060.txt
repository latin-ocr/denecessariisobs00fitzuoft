a fixed tariff. If for any reason the payments in kind were in-
sufficient to discharge the sheriff’s debt, we are left to suppose that
the difference was paid in money. This system lasted until the
reign of Henry Ι, when two causes brought about an alteration.
, In the first place the king began to require actual coin ‚· and in the
next place the burden of transporting the produce demanded
produced serious complaints. Accordingly a commission was
appointed to examine into the whole question; the food payments
were replaced by money payments3 the farm charged upon the
sheriff was revalued; and it was ordered that he should be
responsible for the payment of the whole, and pay at the Ex-
chequer ² ad scalam. This last term is explained to imply an extra
payment of 6d. on each pound to cover any loss that might arise
from the wear of the coin. In process of time the wear of the
coinage compelled the introduction of payments ad pensum, or by
actual weight of silver2. Finally Roget of Salisbury, when Treasurer,
made the rule that owing to the debased state of the coinage all
silver paid in was to be tested, and the farm paid in silver of proper

fineness. This was called payment blanch, and was usual under
Henry ΙΙ.

Now it must be observed that the account is completely
traditional except in one point, viz. where the author appeals to
the fact that entries of payments ad scalam and ad pensum occur
on the Pipe Rolls of Henry Ι. Nevertheless the tradition is good
of its kind. Nigel, Bishop of Ely, nephew of Roger of Salisbury
and father of our author, was employed in the king's service in
1 130 as Treasurer of N ormandy³‚ and his evidence would be good
as to the practice under Henry Ι. Richard Fitz-Nigel further cites
men whom he has seen himself, who had themselves seen the
provisions brought to the king's court. The period to be bridged
is short—Ad). 1100 to A.D. 1180—only eighty years. We must
therefore be caresul not to reject the story of the Dialogus without
due consideration.

We may now turn to the other passages in the Dialogus in
which these methods of payment are mentioned. The most
striking of these (I. iv) is remarkable for two reasonS. On the one
hand it recognizes that blanch farm goes back to Saxon times,

¹ Note that this is the first appearance of the word ‘ Exchequer ⁷ in the story;
the food payments were made to the Curia.

² solum in Dialogus, Ι. vii. C should not be pressed.
