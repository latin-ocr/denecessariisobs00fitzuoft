192 DE SCACCAnro

unable to be present, being on the king's business, but received
a compensating allowance (P. R. 31 Hen. 1, p. 140 ‘ In liberatione
eiusdem Cancellarii de .xliii. diebus in quibus nonfuit ad Scaccarium
cum aliis baronibus Regis ἐκ) 15s.').

P. 97, l. 23. fundos habent. These fundi appear on the Pipe
Roll as Terre Date. A familiar instance is the estate called
Highworth or Sevenhampton in Wilts, which the family of Fitz-
Gerald held by the serjeanty of the chamberlainship of the
Exchequer (Round, Commune of London, p. 83); also Amesbury,
where a rent of 220 blanch held in 21 Hen. II by Hugh Hose
reappears in 1 Ric. Ι, as having been held successively by Stephen
de Camera and tbe wife of Alan de Nevill.

l. 31. Axehitophel. We cannot identify the councillor‚ but
an inspection of Pipe Roll 31 Henry I shows that the incident took
place before 1130.

P. 98, l. 9. indulserat omnium. The passage does not
clearly explain the privilege granted, but a comparison with the
writ quoted below shows that the denarii are moneys due to the
king as judicial amercements. Instances may be quoted from
the Pipe Rolls, e. g. ‘Idem vicecomes reddit compotum de una
marca de Lodningehundredo quia negauerunt quod prius dixerunt.
In thesauro xj.s. Et in perdonis per breue regis Militibus de
Templo 1.d.’ Pipe Roll 1 Ric. Ι, p. 51. The same phrase is
employed in cases of ‘ murdrum.' From the same roll, p. 126, may
be quoted an instance of amercement pro deficta: ‘Idem vice-
comes reddit compotum de dimidia marca de Thoma de Sancto
Mauro pro desectu3 et de una marca de Ricardo filio Tedrici
pro eodem. In perdonis per breue regis militibus de Templo xx.s.’
On the other hand, in items relating to the forest the phrase is still
in pardonis per libertatem carte. But see II. xii. C, below, and note.

P. 99, 1. 5. scutagium. Land granted out by the king to
hold by military service is valued in terms of ‘ knights'3 it is to
be held by the service osone knight, or half a knight or such units
and fractions of knights as the king may determine3 the grantee
is then bound to find for the feudal army that number of fully
armed horsemen (vuldes), to serve for a period of forty days,
and this service is the seruz'cz‘um debitum of the particular fee. It
was within the power of such a tenant to enfeoff sub-tenants in
his lands to perform his service, but the number of knights so
enfeoffed bore no necessary relation to his seruz'cz'um debitum. It
