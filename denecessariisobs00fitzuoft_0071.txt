INTRODUCTION 41

is not free from difficulty, it will be most convenient to give a full
translation of the most important passage ¹.

‘ Now since we have mentioned tallies, consider briefly how the
cutting of a tally is done. There are two kinds of tallies, one
called a tally simply, the other called a memoranda tally. The
length of the tally, properly so called, is the distance between the
end of the forefinger and the thumb‚ when the thumb is stretched
out ; and at one end there is a small hole bored. The memoranda
tally, which is always made for payments that are to be blanched,
is somewhat shorter, because after the assay by which the farm is
blanched the original memoranda tally is destroyed, and then first
only acquires the length of a tally when the tally of combustion is
tied to it. The fashion of cutting is as follows: A thousand pounds
is cut at the top of the tally, by a cut the thickness of the palm of
the hand ,- then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of the
thumb3 a score of pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single
pound, the width of a fat barleycom; a shilling, rather narrower,
yet so that converging cuts remove some of the wood and leave
there a little notch; a penny is made by a single cut without re-
moving any wood. On the edge where the thousand is cut no
other number must be put, saving only the half of a thousand, and
this by removing the half part of that cut and putting it lower on
the tally. Similarly you shall cut a hundred, if you have no thou—
sands, or a score of pounds, or a single pound. 1f you have several
thousands or hundreds or scores to cut, they are to be cut in the
same way 3 on the more open edge² of the same tally, that is, on
the edge which is uppermost when the note is written on the tally,
the larger number must be cut, and the smaller on the other edge 3
and on the more open edge the highest number is at the top, and
on the less open edge the smallest number. There is no cut to
signify a mark of silver; it is set out in shillings. The mark of
gold is cut like a pound, in the middle of the tally. A gold penny
is not cut exactly like a silver penny, but by cutting perpendicularly
into the tally, not on the slope as is done in the silver penny.’

The only effective comment upon this passage is to be obtained
by the actual inspection ³ of a tally or of the pictures in the third
volume of the Pipe Roll Society’s publications. It is, however,
