strict. He may (a) send his eldest son (Madox, ibid. ξ 5, p. 661,
note m), that is, if he is sick‚ (b) if he is engaged on the King's
business he must get the King’s writ (or in the absence of the King
the Justiciar's writ) nominating some one at the Exchequer to act
for him, e. g. his brother (Mad0x‚ ibid. p. 659, note k). In some
cases he personally presents his attorney before the King (ibid.
p. 658, note c). (c) If he is summoned abroad on the King’s
service, or has leave to go home, he must personally present his
attorney at the Exchequer (ibid. p. 660 notes z to d).

P. 123, l. 5. alter vel vterque3 ‘one or both of those sent shall
be his knight or a layman connected with him in blood or in some
other way! The exact force of ‘miles' here is doubtful, but
compare below Π. xxi and xxii, where the double sense of ‘ miles '
as the subordinate of a ‘ dominus ' and a person of definite social
rank clearly appears.

l. 8. clericos; note the ecclesiastical point of view: it is not

l. 23. in forulo . . . meminimus. Cf. 1. v. G above and
Madox, H. E. xxiii. ξ 5, p. 659, note g, ‘Vicecomes Norhumber-
landie assignauit loco suo ad respondendum ad Scaccarium Willel-
mum de C. per breue Regis quod est in forulo Marescalli.’ Ex
Memor. 11 Hen. III Rot. 3 a.

Al. 33. ‘ Willelmus . . . Londonia.' This formula, at first
reserved exclusively for this case, carne to be employed sor the
other cases also. (See Madox, H E. loc. cit„ p. 659, notes n and
o.) This was especially the case in those counties which had
Sheriffs in see, when the whole business was transacted by the
under-sheriffs appointed by them and presented at the Exchequer.

P. 124, l. 18. ligius. A tenant's lord is the lord from whom he
holds land, his liege lord is the one lord to whom he is bound by
more than the relation of over-lord and tenant. Cf. Leges Henrz'ci
primi, c. 43, ξ 3 sqq. ‘ Si quis diuersos diuersorum feodos teneat,
