226 DE SCACCARIO

P. 138, 1. 4. ii. denarios in septimanam. This was the ⁵
recognized rate of interest charged by the Jews (Pollock and
Maidand, i. p. 452). It was not, however, the only rate of interest,
since 1d. and 3d. a week are also known to have been charged (see
Jacobs, Thesews in Angevz'n England‚ pp. 87, 308, sq).

1. 5. Non publicas autem. Of these usuries there are two
kinds ; first, the land or ehurch may be transferred to the creditor
with the natural issues of it which are not to be reckoned in favour
of the debtor, until he discharge the debt ; this is the more venial
kind, but is expressly condemned by the Council of Tours (1163)
cap. 2 (Corpus Iuris Canonici, Dec. III. tit. v. c. 1) ; the second kind,
in which the creditor not only takes the issues but charges interest
as well, is too obviously usury to require condemnation.

1. 15. pro x. libris. This is a mere abstract of a charter
pledging land and is in consequence obscure; probably the author
means the 100 marks for the principal of the debt, while the
second sum of fi 10 is the interest payable yearly. Compare
Charter 51 in Ancient Charters (Pipe Roll Society, vol. 9).

l. 17. eum post mortem creditoris: cf. Glanvill, X. viii.
6 ‘ Cum vero res immobilis ponitur in vadium ita quod inde facta
fuerit seisina ipsi creditori, et ad terminum, aut ita conuenit inter
creditorem et debitorem quod exitus et redditus interim se acquietent‘
aut sic quod in nullo se acquietent. Prima conuentio iusta est et
tenet ς secunda iniusta est et inhonesta, que dicitur mortuum
vadium; sed per Curiam domini Regis non prohibetur fieri et
tamen reputat eam pro specie usure. Unde si quis in tali vadio
decesserit et post mortem eius hoc fuerit probatum, de rebus eius
non aliter disponetur quam de rebus usurarii.'

1. 32. De hiis tamen excidentibus, The admission that
these casual profits do not come under the head ‘ De Propresturis
et Escaetis’ shows that their classification as escaete is purely
arbitrary and does not rest on any common usage.

P. 139, l. 6. siout supra dietum est: i. e. Ι. xi. B, C above.
The scholar returns to the question of the goods of felons, and
raises the question why the goods of a villein selon go to the King
and not to the lord. The answer of the master is that this is the
rule under the Assize of Clarendon c. 3 (Select Clzarlers, p. 143).

1. 18. Quod si dominis. This passage emphasizes the
distinction between the legal and the actual right of a lord to
the chattels of his villeins. If the lords had exercised their legal
