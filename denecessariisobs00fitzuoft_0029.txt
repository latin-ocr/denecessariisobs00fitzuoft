INTRODUCTION 11

part of Ovid he had also read, but his own Latin verse is unclassical
and clumsy.

His acquaintance with Seneca, whom he quotes once (I. Prol. A.),
is probably only second-hand ; and some of the tags whose origin we
have been unable to trace, may be due to the use of books of quota-
tions. His logical expressions, which are not unfrequent, are due
directly or indirectly to Boethius. As a clerk‚ he was familiar with the
Vulgate, which he quotes, especially the Psalms, at every opportunity.

He had read the Inslz‘lules ; but for the Dz'gesl he seems to have
trusted to some Summa, or collection of Brocards. But if we
remember that he was all his life in the company of the foremost
men of his time, we shall the less hesitate to attribute much of his
learning to the opportunities thus given to him. The store he sets
by official tradition accounts at once for his knowledge and his
misconceptions. Altogether he may be summed up as a man of
affairs, liberally educated and knowing enough to do his work
intelligently. He is in no sense a learned man.

Nevertheless two ¹ references in the Dialogus might seem to show
him in the character of an author. The T rzkolumnis, he says, ‘is
a book which Ι wrote in my youth, containing the threefold history
of England under Henry II, and I called it the “Trieolumnis,”
because it was in three columns. In the first column I put matters
concerning the English Church‚ and some papa] bulls ,· in the
second column Ι placed the great deeds of the king, which are past
belief ; the third column contains many matters, public and private,
and some legal proceedings. If you can get hold of this book, do
not lose the opportunity ; it will be both pleasant and profitable to
students of the reign.’ Now this is the tone of an elderly man
looking back on a youthful performance, of which he is rather
proud. It is, therefore, rather surprising to hear at a later date
that this book contains an account of the king's conduct during the
rebellion of his son in 1 174 ; which must have been written when
the author was already over forty years of age, and was just about
to begin the composition of the Dialogus. Attempts have been
made to reconcile the two passages ², but the contradiction seems
to us to remain apparent. It is, in fact, inconsistent with the idea
of a finished historical work ; nor indeed has any successful attempt
been made to identify it among the chronicles that have come down*
