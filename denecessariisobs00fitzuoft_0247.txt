NOTES 183

computate and perdono go into the foruli of the marshal. The
duplicates of all the writs remain with the chancellor's clerk as
evidence of the transaction. The duplicates of similar writs made
in the Curia were brought into the Exchequer when it sat, by the
‘Clericus Constabularie' (see I. vi. D, below). The writ quoted
by Madox (p. 268) and referred to above is cited by him ‘Ex
rescripto Autographi in Archiuis Turris Londoniae.' The document
he saw was accordingly such a contrabreue preserved in the
Chancery. Many instances will be found of the preparation of
contrabreuia in the printed Close Rolls of the reign of Henry
111, from which it appears that at that date contrabreuz'a were
only made of the writs to accountants which they would naturally
produce at the Exchequer‚ not of writs to the treasurer or barons.
The place of these contrabreuz‘a is ultimately taken by the ‘ Origi-
nalia Rolls ' (cf. Roluli Litt. Claus. Ι. p. x).

l. 19. dum sibi propitius est. Liebermann (Ez'nl. p. 8)
regards propitius as corrupt, relying on the omission of the word
by N. We have not however ventured to accept his conjecture of
‘ prepeditio' against the combined reading of C. and R. It seems
more natural to suppose that it means ‘when he is gracious to
himself,’ i. e. gives himself a holiday.

l. 25. sequitur. . . equis: cf. Vergil, Aen. ii. 724 ‘sequi-
turque patrem non passibus aequis?
