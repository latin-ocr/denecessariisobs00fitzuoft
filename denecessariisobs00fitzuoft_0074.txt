44 ’ INTRODUCTION

explains that the accountant who is in debt must not leave the
limits of the town where the Exchequer is sitting for more than
one day. Moreover, we are expressly t01d¹ that some of the con-
tents of the Treasury are moved about in the care of the Treasurer
and Chamberlains, and follow the Exchequer in its sittings. We
may therefore conclude that the home of the Exchequer was in
Winchester, that it frequently sat in London, but that it might sit
in any town in the kingdom.

The evidence of the Pipe Rolls on the point is only indirect, but
the following dates and places seem probable. In 1 156² the Ex-
chequer sat at Westminster ; in 1 158 ³ one Exchequer session was
held at Worcester ; in Δ·1 162 ⁴ one session was at Oxford; in 1164 ⁵
the Easter session was at London ς the Michaelmas session of the¹
same year was at Northampton⁶; in 1166⁷ one session was at
Worcester; in 1175Β the Easter session was at Oxford, and the
Michaelmas one at London. It is not necessary to add instances
to these. Enough has been done to show that there was no per-
manent place of sitting for the Exchequer. Now it must be
remembered that if the sessions of the Exchequer were not fixed,
neither was the Receipt of the Exchequer fixed. Both offices, in
fact, must have moved together, and were essentially inseparable.

We now come to a somewhat thorny question, the meaning of
the word ‘ thesaurus) Attaehed to the lower Exchequer is a depart-
ment vaguely described as the Treasury. The usher and watch-
man of the Treasury⁹ are officers of the lower Exchequer. The
Treasury contains the seal ¹⁰, which only leaves it when brought up
from the lower to the upper Exchequer. It also contains ¹¹ certain
chests, which hold Domesday Book and many rolls and tallies need-
ful for the daily business of the Exchequer‚ wherever that may be.
It also is the receptacle for money paid by accountants ¹². In fact,
it is clearly the strong-room of the Exchequer court, closely attached
to the lower Excheqoer, and existing wherever the Exchequer
existed. Moreover, when the sittings of the Exchequer ceased‚ the
existence-of the Treasury was suspended. The watchman¹³, like
the other officials of the lower Exchequer, ceased to be paid, and,
