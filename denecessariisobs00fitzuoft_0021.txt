INTRODUCTION 5

The other cover, now f. 68, contains more memoranda of
Controllers of the Great Roll, down to Thomas Harford, admitted
14 Henry VI.

Minor MSS. may be classed in three groups:

1. Copies of C.

Brz'tz'sl‘z Museum, MS. Harley 688, ff. 1—94. A folio on paper.
A modern copy of C.

Trz'nz'gy College‚ Cambridge, O. 10. 4. A seventeenth century
MS. entitled ‘Occamus ί De Necessariis observantiis Scaccariig
sive Ι Niger Liber Scaccarii.’ There is a note on f. 1 attributing
the authorship to Richard Beaumes, Bishop of London. As Coke
cites the Dialogus under the title of ‘Ockam,’ it is possible that
he may have used this MS„ which has a marginal note, ‘ Ockham
vocat Coke.’

2. Copies of R. Besides H there are—

Caius College‚ Cambridge, ξῑ-ξὲ. ‘Gervasii Tilburiensis Ι de
necessariis Scaccarii Ι observandis dialogus! Seventeenth century.
This contains an extract from Bale about Gervase of Tilbury.

Bodleian Library, MS. Laud. Misc. 654. ‘Dialogus de Scac-
cario et ejus officiariis‚' &c. This MS. is imperfect, ending with
the words ‘ cum autem in manu ' (ΙΙ. 10. D). It is unusually large
(13{'' >< 11''), and was apparently written at the Exchequer early
in the sixteenth century. The chapter headings have not all been
filled in, and the last six leaves are blank. The book has a rough
parchment cover, and probably was once fastened with a strap.

3. Copies of N.

This is the most numerous group of MSS„ and the majority
possess a distinctive character, being apparently derived from
a copy of the Black Book made by William Roper, chief clerk of
the Queen's Bench (1523-1577), Sir Thomas More’s son-in-law.
They usually contain an extract from Bale upon Gervase of
Tilbury3 Memoranda ‘De Averiis pascendis,' &c.‚ from the Red
Book3 and an Index Rerum. All have a note of a MS. of the ‘ Otia
Imperialia’ in the possession of the Archbishop of Canterbury and
of Roper’s MS. Of these are—

Britz'slz Muscam, MS. Lansdowne 567. A copy of Roper's MS.
by Robert Multon, AJ). 1577 (without the ‘ De Averiis pascendis’
or the Index).

Brimlz Museum, MS. Harley 4156. Sixteenth or seventeenth
century.
