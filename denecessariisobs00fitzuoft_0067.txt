INTRODUCTION 37

The evidence of the Pipe Rolls of Henry 11 does not bear
directly on the statement of the Dialogus. In them we find two
systems of payment only, ad numerum and blanch. We find the
f arms of the counties gradually reconstituted ¹, and there is abundant
evidence that many of the county mints continued working till
1 1 80 ².

We have now to consider the evidence of the chroniclers in its
bearing on the question of the origin of the system of blanch pay-
ments. It will be found that two monetary reforms are recorded
during the reign of Henry Ι, viz. Λα). 1108³ and A.D. 11254: the
latter of these is confirmed by the Pipe Roll of 31 Henry 1⁵.

We may now return to the account given by the Dialogus.
That account is obviously not complete, and our other materials
do not enable us to fill up the gaps. On the one hand, if we re-
member that the account deals not with the general question of
the payment of money, but with the more limited question of the
payment of the farm of the county, it is not necessarily incorrect.
On the other hand, it certainly suggests several incorrect state·
ments, though it is not clear that the author could have realized all
the meaning his language would have borne to modern ears.

We have attempted to construet a theory of the history of the
subject, which we offer as on the whole not inconsistent with the
authorities here summarized; but it must be remembered that our
attempted reconstruction rests upon slender foundations. At the
bottom of the farm of the county lies the farm of the royal demesne
manor⁶; and the money farm of the demesne manor rests upon
a basis of original rents in kind, estimated in terms of supplies for
a day. In Domesday we find these rents in food expressed in
terms of money; and we may guess that the meaning of this was
that the sheriff was charged with the money value of these food
rents, and credited with the money value of any part of them that
was paid directly to the royal household. Early in the reign of

from the pleas apart from the farms of the mauors.
