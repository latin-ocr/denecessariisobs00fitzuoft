NOTEs 1 75

These and the vouchers formerly in the custody of the Marshal
ultimately became records of the King's Remembrancer.

P. 72, 1. 32. huic traditur seruandus. Madox loc. cit. n. (ο)
quotes the Memoranda, Hilary Term, 31 Hen. 111 (Communia Rot.
5 a) ‘ Line. Radulphus Basset liberatus est Marescallo pro arreragiis
compoti sui3 set habet diem vt Priso, quamdiu Rex suerit in
Ciuitate et Scaccarium sederit.' The carcer custodie publice men·
tioned below was the Fleet prison, if the Exchequer sat in London.

P. 73, 1. 1. oum sceleratis deputari, ‘to be reekoned among
the transgressors': cf. Isai. liii. 12 ‘cum sceleratis reputatus est‚'
and Luc. xxii. 37 ‘ cum iniquis deputatus est!

Ita . . . in agendis vicecomitis: cf. ΙΙ. xxi, below. This
sentence reads like a marginal note on the original text. It is
clear that the modern division into chapters had not been made at
the time at which it was written, as the chapter ‘ De agendis vice-
comitum multipliciter’ is the third of book 11: the reference is
therefore to the second book as a whole.

1. 6. fidem . . . suscipiat. Several instances of this oath are
quoted by Madox from the Memoranda Rolls (H. E. c. xxiii.
ξ 22. p. 699). In the earliest case quoted (2 & 3 Hen. 111) the
oaths are, (1) ‘ quod fideliter computabit‚’ (2) ‘ et quod non recedet
nisi facta pace de arreragiis.' An oath given in 52 Hen. 111 is
‘quod non recedet a Civitate Londonia per unam leucam donec
habuerit allocationes suas et brevia.’

l. 9. leugata (leuca, a league). The leugata or ‘lowey' of
a town is the district immediately surrounding it over which the
privileges or Jurisdiction of the town extended. The same word is
used in the same sense of a monastery. Other forms are leucate,
bannaleuca, and sometimes ‘leuca’ simply, cf. modern French
banlieue, ‘ suburbs.' In England the conception died out early,
and only survived in local usage, e. g. at Pevensey, where the
district subject to the J'urisdiction of the castle was called the
‘ Lowey ' or ⁴ League.’

l. 18. Hie taleas. The sheriff receives a tally for each sum
paid in by himself or by the debtors of his county on account of
the debts with which he is charged, and a ‘memoranda ’ or short
tally for what he pays in on account of the sarm of the county.
The tally cutter produces the counterfoils of these tallies, thus
checking the sheriff as to each amount paid in thesauro. Further,
as the debts of the county take precedence of the sarm, the sheriff
