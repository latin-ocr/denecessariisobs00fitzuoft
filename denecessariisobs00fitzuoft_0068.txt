38 INTRODUCTION

Henry I this system was replaced by a system of money payments
to the sheriff‚ and by him to the Exchequer3 and the change was
accompanied by a revaluation of the farms. We may perhaps
suggest 1108, the date of the first reform of the coinage, as a
possible date for the introduction of monetary payments at the
Exchequer, with the provision that they should be made ad scalam.
The second reform of the coinage, in 1125, may in the same way
be the time at which payment ad pensum was enforced ; and the
Pipe Roll of 1130 certainly proves that payments blanch had by
that time become more common than they were in Domesday,
while payment ad pensum still subsisted. We are not compelled
to assume that the introduction of any of these three methods of
payment necessarily coincided with its invention. Blanching, cer-
tainly, was a process of great antiquity‚ and the devices of payment
ad scalam or ad pensum are likely enough to have been employed
at any date.

So far as the question of the antiquity of the Exchequer is affected,
it is pretty clear that the main basis of the system of payments on
account of sarm is traceable to Saxon times, and that it received con-
siderable modification between the date of Domesday and 1130.

In considering the arithmetic employed at the Exchequer, we
are immediately confronted by two contrivances, the tally and the
exchequer. We are also told that there was a time when only tallies
were used, and when there was no exchequer. The nature of the
tally is pretty well understood, but the word ‘exchequer' has gathered
round it so many connotations, that it may be useful to consider
what the arithmetical device known as the exchequer was. It was,
says the Dialogus ¹, a four-sided board measuring 10 ft. by 5 ft„ with
a raised edge round it. lt was covered with a black eloth ruled
with white lines a foot apart. It is not clearly stated whether the
ruling was in squares or columns, but the comparison to a chess-
board or draught-board makes it clear that it was ruled in squares.
In any case the columns are the important facts, the transverse
lines are only for convenience. In all there were seven columns ² ;
beginning from the right, the first column was for pence, the
second for shillings‚ the third for pounds, the fourth for scores of
pounds, the fifth for hundreds, the sixth for thousands‚ and the
seventh for tens of thousands‚ The occurrence of any one of these
units was indicated by a sign placed in the column in question.
