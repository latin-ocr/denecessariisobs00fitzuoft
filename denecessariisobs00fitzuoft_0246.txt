182 DE SCACCARIO

Underlining as described in the text, perhaps the most usual form
of deleting words. (4) Expunging or placing a dot under each
letter to be left out. (5) Obliteration (cf. II. ii. B, below), or
blotting out, i. e. covering the whole word or passage with ink as
a press censor ‘ bisks' an objectionable passage in a newspaper.

P. 81, l. 19. in serie: along the line, not above it as usual.
This rule is not strictly observed, as will be seen on reference to
the printed Pipe Rolls (cf. P. R. 21 Hen. ΙΙ, p. 120 n, p. 161 n,
p. 184 n. N.B. The so-called C. R. of this year is really the P. R.).
It was subsequently renewed in 16 Edward ΙΙ, almost in the words
of the Dialogus (Red Book, ed. Han, iii. p. 858).

l. 21. seriptis patentibus. Here, apparently, as in II. ii.
B, C, below, simply a public document. Letters patent, as after-
wards technically distinguished from charters or letters close, were
not differentiated as early as the reign of Henry ΙΙ. For ‘ Littere
Patentes' in another sense, cf. II. xxvii. C, below.

l. 31. Cura, labor, studium. Probably an echo of the
‘Epitaphium Senecae’:—

‘Cura, labor, meritum, sumpti pro munere honores,
Ite, alias post hane sollicitate animas.’
Sen. Opp. ed. Haase, iii. p. 482.

P. 82, l. 1. breuia regis. The ‘scriptor cancellariae' only
writes the writs ordered to issue by the barons at the Exchequer,
viz. those of ‘liberate ’ or payment, of ‘ computate' or allowance,
and os ‘perdono' or pardon 3 the awkward use of ‘nichilominus'
suggests that the words ‘ nichilominus . . . decreuerint ' are an after-
thought.

1. 18. Η. rex, etc. The writs printed by Madox (Ilz'sl.
Exch„ x. ξ 13. note q, p. 268) and Round (Anc. Charlers, No. 58 ς
Ρ. R. Soc. vol. 10. p. 96), though no doubt similar to Exchequer
writs of the period, are neither of them attested at the Exchequer,
and must accordingly have been issued from the ‘ Curia Regis.’
Both are writs of Liberale.

1. 23. oportet etiam. The sense of this passage is as
follows. All writs either of liberale, or perdono, or of computate
made at the Exchequer are made in duplicate. The originals
when brought back to the Exchequer by the persons in whose
favour they are issued, remain, if writs of liberate, in the hands
of the treasurer and chamberlains as their i⁷oucher5 those of
