with escheats‚ wardships, fines and taxation, as with the Pleas of the
Crown or the decision of Civil Causes (cf. Capitula Itineris, 1194
in Hoveden‚ III. 263). The place of custody of the Assize Rolls
was the Treasury of the Exchequer down to comparatively modern
times (Madox, H. E. xx. ξ 8, p. 563).

P. 114, 1. 1. hiis taxatis a maioribus. New debts arising
from the eyres, like the old debts copied from the last Pipe Roll, are
considered at the Exchequer, and more or less is called up ac-
cording to circumstances. This account seems also to include the
‘ Affeering' of amercements, which was a revision by the barons of
the Exchequer of the amercements imposed by the Justices. Both
old and new amercements were subject to this revision (cf. Madox,
H. E. xiv. ξ 1. p. 366, notesgr and k).

l. 5. Fuerunt tamen . . . eontinentur. We have bracketed
this passage as being most probably an interpolation and as inter-
rupting the argument.

1. 7. subdisiunctiue. This doctrine is borrowed from the
Civil Law. Cf. ngr. 50, 16, 124, ‘Haec verba, ille aut ille, non
solum disiunctiuae sed etiarn subdisiunctiuae orationis sunt, &c.’

The argument is stated awkwardly, but seems to suggest that, as
vel—vel may be equivalent to et—et the converse may also be the
case. Perhaps however vel may be a slip on the part of the author
who may have meant to write et.

1. 15. ex nouella constitutione. Cf. Ι. ν. Β above and
note. If the sheriff finds that the debtor has no land or goods in
his county, he is to send a fresh writ on to any other officer
in whose jurisdiction the debtor has land or goods. The tense of
⁴ habuerit ' is simply due to the tense of ‘ noueris?

Ι. 27. vacuus: cf. Juvenal, x. 22 ‘ Cantabit vacuus coram
latrone viator.'

l. 30. Ille enim. Translate ‘ For that officer, to whose juris-
diction he (the debtor) had removed with his property because of this
sear, having no order thereupon, did not dare to seize his property.'

P. 115, l. 4. excusat. The reading ‘ exerceat ’ is very tempting ;
but no stress can be laid on the mood of ‘ excusat ' as a reason for
the change.

l. 13. si bene memini: cf. 11. i. A above.

1. 25. quidam visus compotorum fiunt. The Sheriff’s
account was divided, in the phraseology of a later date, into three
parts, the Profer, the View, and the Summ. The Proser is the
