Demesne.' For a curious example of this use see Statutes of the
Realm 1 Ric. ΙΙ, c. 6.

P. 107, l. 35. iux-i scripto. This is not of course a reference to
the Roman Law, which is frequently referred to on the continent
as ‘Ius Scriptum ’‚ but probably to the ‘Leis Willelme' (Leges
Willelmi 1), a code drawn up by some private person after the
Conqueror's time and attributed to him (cf. Liebermann loc. cit„
Pollock and Maitland, H. E. L. i. p. 79). The terms ‘ Merchenelage,
Denelage, Westsaxenelage' occur in the Latin version of ‘Leis
Willelme ' (Leges Wz'llelmz· Ι. 2).

P. 108, 1. 3. Neustrie. The allusion is probably to the ‘ mur-
drum’ and the ‘view of frank-pledge.' See above 1. x, and for
stanit-pledge, Liebermann, Leges Edwards Confessorz's‚ § 58. But
neither institution is known to have prevailed in Normandy.

l. 10. verbis communibus annotata: i. e. no attempt was
made to represent English or Anglo-Latin words by classical
equivalents.

l. 12. Fit autem descriptio. This account of Domesday
Book shows that our author saw it as we now have it. Each
county is divided into numbered chapters setting out successively
the lands of the King and of the various tenants in capite. Within
these chapters the description proceeds by hundreds as a mle, and
within these divisions by manors‚ the hidage of each being stated.
A numbered list of the tenants in chief is prefixed in each county,
and serves as a contents table.

l. 32· hida. Mr. Round has shown that a hide (in Domesday
Book) consists of four virgates of arable, each of 30 acres, each
of these hides or virgates being an unit of assessment and not
an unit of area. (Feudal England‚ pp. 36-44.) Centum must be
taken as a loose rendering of ‘hundred‚’ the old ‘long hundred'
being meant. The parallel reckoning by carucates and bovates is
not mentioned in the Dialogus.

l. 33. Hundredus. The number of hides in the hundred
was variable. A hundred might contain as few as 40 or as many
as 300 hides (Round, Feudal England, pp. 60 sq.). Mr. Round
suggests that it usually approximated to an even number, the
county being divided into so many hundreds, and the hundreds
assessed at so many hides each, the assessment being ultimately
distributed amongst the vills of which the hundred consisted
(Feudal England‚ pp. 91, 92). The phrase ‘secundum quod diuisa
