208 DE SCACCARIO

payment made on the Sheriff’s arrival at the Exchequer in each
term (cf. II. iv. A below). The View is the viva voce inquiry
in Easter term described here. The Summ is the final operation in
Michaelmas term described in II. iv. E to II. xxviii. below. (Cf.
Madox‚ H. E. xxiii. ξ 2. pp. 644-9.) It appears from the instances
quoted by Madox (loc. cit. pp. 646-8) that the distinction between
a View and an Account is that in the first case the Sheriff merely
gives his word as to the allowances due to him, in the latter he must
produce his vouchers (e. g. P. R. 15 Hen. II, p. 110, Honor

Constabularie. De hoc honore non reddidit idem Galfridus de Ver Ι

compotum, sed visum tantum per verum dictum ipsius, quia non
habuit guarantum Regis de terris datis et aliis exitibus eiusdem
honoris). However the sums due and the sums paid were stated
and a balance was struck. The Memoranda showing this balance
were put down as stated here and kept till Michaelmas. If an
account could not be cleared at Michaelmas the Memorandum might
be attached to the Pipe Roll as in the case alluded to above, where
such a note is quoted by Madox from a schedule to the Pipe Roll.
In the reigns of Richard I and John the Easter views were so
attached. Towards the end of Henry ΙΙΙ they appear on the
Memoranda Rolls‚ of which they became a special part, and they
ultimately formed a separate series (Bird, Handbook, 236), known as
‘ States and Views of account.' The final quittance is given at the
Michaelmas account.

P. 115,1. 29. memoranda. The origin of the Lord Treasurer's
Remembrancer and his Memoranda Roll is probably to be
sought in the Clericus Τ hesaurariz‘ and the process described here
(cf. the previous note). Both series of Memoranda Rolls begin in
1 Henry ΠΙ.

1. 33. Insuper. This passage refers not to the Pipe Roll
but to the Memorandum of the Sheriff's Easter view. Madox
(H. E. xxiii. ξ 2, p. 646 n. w.) quotes an instance from a schedule
attached to the Pipe Roll of 8 Richard 13 ‘ Compotus vicecomitum
Anglie factus in termino Pasche anni octaui regni Regis Ricardi.’
