232 DE SCACCARIO

villeins, this last only in distraint for scutage. Bracton gives the·
order as, first the property of the debtor's villeins, second the
debtor's own property, third the property of the debtor’s under-
tenants. The position of the villein has worsened, though the
legal theory has remained the same. It must be noted that
Bracton is dealing with the law of distress as between private
individuals.

P. 147, 1. 3. mutatoria vestimentorum. Cf. 4 Reg. v, 5
‘ decem mutatoria vestimentorum.'

1. 4. equi vsuales: trained horses.

l. 20. Et, nota. The distinction here drawn is between a
knight by stolus, and a professional soldier. The latter's tools are
exempt on the same principle as that on which the plough oxen
are so far as possible spared.

P. 148, 1. 12. siout supra dietum est. Cf. II. x. J, K above.

l. 15. Pro scutagio namque. A tenant-in-chief charged
with scutage might distrain upon his knights, or the sheriff would
do so for him. It was a valid excuse for the non-payment of
scutage that a lord had not been able to recover it from his under·
tenant. Cf. Madox, H. E. xvi. ξ 8, p. 469.

1. 17. ascriptitiorum, i. e. the villeins of the under-tenants.

1. 20. Vidi . . . vendantur. This is an interruption to the
argument, which is resumed at ‘ Quod si.'

1. 30. Item admonendus. Various cases are quoted by
Madox (H. E. xxiii. ξ 8, p. 666).

P. 149, 1. 15. Quisquis enim. See on this passage Pollock
and Maitland‚ H. Ε.. L. ii. 457, 512. It must be remembered
that the statement here is made from a financial not a legal point
of view. Legally it is only roughly accurate.

l. 26. indefinite, sc. propositiones: a reminiscence of the
logical division of propositions into universal, particular, and
indefinite. The logical rule is that indefinite propositions in
necessary or impossible matter shall be taken as universal, in con-
tingent matter as particular (cf. Aldrich, Artis Logicae Rudimenta,
ii. ξ 3) ; ‘ The Logician‚ however, may use indefinites as particulam,
not assigning the quantity from the matter, but admitting an
indefinite premise (and therefore conclusion) where the rules of the
figure do not require an universal. Hence the minor premise in fig. Ι,
may be indefinite, but not the major. See An. Pr, 1. 4. 9 ’ (Mansel,
ad loc. cit). The author means that laymen use indefinite proposi·
