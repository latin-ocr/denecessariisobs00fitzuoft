NOTES 237

as in the case of ‘pene pecuniarie'; they resemble the ‘sponte
oblata ’ in that Queen's gold was payable upon them ; but compare
c. xxvi. below. Note, however, that in practice the King would
seize the estate until the heir gave him security sor the payment of
relief (GlanvilL IX. vi. 3), and that an heir taking possession without
leave might when discovered be compelled to account for all the
issues of the estate during his irregular possession.

P. 156, 1. 4. accipitres scincet vel falcones, ‘Accipiter‘ is
probably used here as a classica] equivalent for ‘falco‚' although
the latter word occurs in Servius and Isidore ; otherwise ‘ accipiter ’
must be taken to mean a tiercel. Of the varieties mentioned ‘ Nor-
rensis ' is presumably the N orwegian gerfalcon, ‘ Hibernensis’ may
be the peregrine, and ‘ Hispanensis ’ the Barbary falcon or perhaps
the Saker. There seems to be no mention of the Goshawk, which
is usually rendered by ‘Asturcus.’ The Hon. Gerald Lascelles
(Falconry, Badmz'nlon Lz'brary) gives the moulting period as April
or May to August sor Eyesses, and July or August to February for
Passage Falcons: which would seem to show that the birds were
taken from their nests and not caught when full grown. ‘ Hornus'
for a hawk in its first plumage is clearly an expedient to avoid
using the mediaeval Latin ⁴ sorus '=‘ soar ’ or ‘ red.’

l. 7. Norrensem. Cf. Pipe Roll 1171 (17 Hen. ΙΙ), p. 10
‘ Stephanus de Reddeham debet 5 mareas et 2 Accipitres Norrenses
pro habendo recto de Widone de Rochesordia de quadam terra in
Norwico‚' ibid. p. 59 ‘ Ricardus Gubiun debet unum Girfalconem
pro recognitione quam habuit de 2 virgatis terre.’

l. 10. austurcariis. ‘Asturcarius,' ‘an ostringer‚’ is said to
be a keeper of goshawks and tiercels. There seems to be some
distinction between ‘asturcarius ’ and ‘ falconarius! Cf. P. R. 18
Hen. ΙΙ p. 4 ⁴ Et Roberto Malduit et Petro de Sandiacra 10 li. ad
faciendum prestitum Austurcariis et Falconariis Regis per breue
Regis.’

l. 20. cauearum antris incluse: a classicism sor muz'e.
Cf. P. R. 1171 (17 Hen. II) p. 23; Et pro 8 Muiis quas Rex
filius Regis fecit fieri in Castello de Saresburia 25s. et Sd. Et pro
3 Muiis quas Bigotus ibidem fecit fieri 115. per breue Regis. Et in
liberatione eiusdem Bigoti et in custamento falconum Regis 725.
et 11d. per breue Regis!

1. 22. vt aquile ε cf. Ps. cii. 5 ‘ renouabitur ut aquilae
iuventus tua.'
