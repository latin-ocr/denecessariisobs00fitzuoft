money pay-ments. Some of the former still remain, especially
honey payments3 but, generally speaking, the firma unius noctis
had been commuted for a money pay-ment. The rents were conse-
quently certain. and payable at a fixed rate in money, or at all
events on a 511161- basis.

4. Mr. Round has pointed out that the ‘firma comitatus’ was
already in existence in the time of Edward the Confessor1. The
farm of Warwickshire. for instance, was 2865 under Edward. with
a honey rent commuted for §24 Ss.; total, ³389 85. Under
William Ι it was ἕης), and there were other payments ². The
latter farm included ‘pleas of the county‚’ and thus is strictly
parallel with the farms on the Pipe Rolls.

5. The money used was coined at various provincial mints,
most of the coumies coining their own money at the county
towns.

The first Pipe Roll, the only roll remaining of the reign of
Henry 1. contains striking evidence of the many changes that must
have taken place between the time of Domesday and the year 1 130.
The system os blanch pay-ments is in sull operation in addition to
payments made κωλῆνα and ad pnsum ³. Comparison of this roll
with Domesday suggests. in fact. that what at the first date was an
exceptional thing had then become normal.

There is, moreover, some reason for supposing that in 1130
a transition was taking place at the Exchequer between the period
in which farms were paid ad pensum and the period in which they
were paid, at any rate largely, in blanch money-⁴.

There are also traces ot* a reorganization of the farms of counties,
particularly in 1116 case of the large group of counties in the hands
of Aubrey de Vere and Richard Basset. There had certainly been
a change since Domesday. Oxfordshire, the Domesday sarm of
which was >5²49 55. 3d.⁵‚ with six ‘sextarii' of honey (worth
about 154), now pays more than :5332 135. rod. The farm of
Warwickshire. on the other hand, appears to have fallen to about
{134 65. 20⁷.
