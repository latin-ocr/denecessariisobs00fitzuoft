230 DE SCACCARIO

deferat). See above, loc. cit. note, for some quotations illustrating the
practice of the Pipe Roll. The other point here insisted on is that
general words will not be construed to cover particular liberties.
Note that the use of the word ‘ seculari ’ shows that the author is
thinking of gifts in frank almoin to ecclesiastics.

Ρ. 143, l. 32. caue tibi, διο. Cf. P. R. 14 Hen. ΙΙ. Norf p. 18
‘ Willelmus de Merlai debet 200 marcas de misericordia, set nichil
inuenitur de suo extra septa ecclesie per fidem vicecomitis? On
¹ corporaliter ¹ cf. II. iv. A above and note.

l. 35. consummatum compotum. See ΙΙ. xxviii. A below.

P. 144, 1. 2. circa initia. See Ι. ν. Η above.

1. 4. Porro: if the debtor is a land-holder, the sheriff is freed
from all liability by swearing that he has found no goods by which
he can distrain the debtor to pay ; on the other hand, if the debtor
is a dweller in a town, whose chief wealth is in money, the sheriff
must first seize all his chattels, and if this is not enough must sell
his house, and in case no purchaser can be found must bar it up
and make what profit he can of any land the debtor may have. Cf.
Pipe Rolls 6-14 Henry ΙΙ for the case of Osward, the moneyer of
Exeter. The final entry in Pipe Roll 14 Henry II, p. 125 is
‘ Oswardus Monetarius debet xviii. [ί. et v. s et vii. d. de miseri-
cordia set aufugit et Eustachius filius Stephani habet domum eius
que erat in manu regis per breue regis.'

l. 12. cuius actio : process against whom has failed. Cf.
above ΙΙ. i. D, ‘ nisi quem sola suprema excusat inopia!

1. 34. mercimoniis inseruiunt. The sense of ‘ inseruire’
must be pressed ,· by the mere fact of engaging in trade the freeman
degenerates: cf. below II. xiii. D.

P. 145, 1. 9. de auxiliis vel donis ciuitatum. Various in-
stances quoted by Madox (H. E. xvii. § 2, 3, pp. 480 sqq.) suggest
that when the county paid a ‘Communis Assisa,' or when the
King's demesnes in the county paid tallage, the cities and boroughs
were permitted to tender ‘ dona ’ or ‘ auxilia' in lieu of the assise
or tallage. The words cannot, however, be thus sharply dis-
tinguished since we find, for instance, ‘ assisa burgi de Oxineford '
(Madox, loc. cit. at p. 485, note a) in 19 Henry ΙΙ, and in 1 Ric. Ι
individual Thanes and Drengs in Northumberland pay ‘ de dono'
under the head of tallage.
