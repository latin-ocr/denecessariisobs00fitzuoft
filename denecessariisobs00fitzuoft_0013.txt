INTRODUCTION

EvEN before the date at which Thomas Madox printed the
Dialogus de Scaccarz'o‚ as an appendix to his Hz‘slory (ff llze
Exclzequer, this treatise had attained to fame among historians
and lawyers. Camden¹, Spelman ², Coke ⁸, and Selden4 have all
cited passages from it, and the numerous MSS. of the sixteenth
and seventeenth century in existence show the importanee our
Elizabethan, Jacobaean, and Caroline antiquaries attached to it. It
was not, however, until 1 71 1 that it appeared in print under the care
of that profound scholar, whose reputation and research raise him
so far above his contemporaries, that he seems almost the only
scientifie English historiari of the century in which he lived. In
his dedication to Chanes, Lord Halisax, he explains the method
adopted by him for the formation of his text. He procured from
the library of Lord Somers two ⁵ modern transcripts of the treatise,
and had one copy made from thern. This copy, probably when
in proof, he with the assistance of George Holmes‚ Deputy Keeper
of the Records in the Tower, collated with the two Exchequer
MSS. known as the Red Book and the Black Book, one of them
reading the on'ginal and the other looking at the copy⁶ the while.
The dedication is dated 1708, while the certificate of collation
placed at the end of the text is dated June, 1707 for the collation
with the Red Book MS„ and August, 1707 for the collation with
the Black Book MS. For many years this edition remained the
only one; and it was not until the year 1870 that Dr. Stubbs
reprinted the treatise in the Select Charlers srorn Madox's text.
In 1875, F. Liebermann‚ Ph.D. of Gottingen‚ published his Ein-
lez'lung z’n den Dialogus de Scaccario, an account of the matter
