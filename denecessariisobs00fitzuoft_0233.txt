clerk.

P. 64, 1. 1. scaccarium: i. e. the counter, over which the
money was pald.

l. 3. non apposito. The reading non is supported by the
weight of manuscript authority. The similar formulae for oaths
given in the Dialogus (Ι. v. H, ΙΙ. xxvii. A, ΙΙ. xxviii. A) contain the
clause secundum conscientiam suam or salva conscientia, which amount
to the modern expression ‘to the best of my knowledge and belief!
In this case, however, no such saving clause is permitted to the
careless payee.

1. 14· vt ponderi respondeant, ‘so that they may balance
the weight.’ 240 heavy pennies would weigh more than a pound,
the same number of light pennies less.

1. 16. quod si numerus . . ., ‘but if the 20 shillings (by
weight) on being counted come to 6d. or more, more than a pound,
the money is judged unworthy to be accepted? The Chamberlain
weighs. out as many pence as will balance the standard pound:
these are then counted and if there are more than 246 the money is
rejected. This treatment only applies to payments made numero.
Payments of farm which have to be assayed are treated differently.

l. 22. in loculum . . . mittuntur, ‘ they are put in a purse.’
This translation seems preferable to ‘ coffer,’ since the word bursa
is used for the same receptacle at a later date (Memoranda Roll

1. 24. examen quod vulgo essaium dicitur, ‘the test
commonly called the assay.‘ Here as usual the author endeavours
to substitute the classical word.

1. 27, examinati . . . fiant. The Treasurer's clerk and the
Chamberlains are to put away separately the lumps of silver
obtained in the assay, and the pennies paid in as the farm. Being
of silver of known standard they will serve for plate or for coinage
for the king's foreign possessions.
