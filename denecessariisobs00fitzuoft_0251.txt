P. 89, l. 1. A quibus vel ob quam. As there has been some
controversy about this obscure chapter, we give here a brief
statement of our conclusions‚ referring to the Introduction (pp. 31
seqq.) for the arguments on which they are based. Originally
the officers of the king’s household called directly upon the tenants
of the royal manors to supply the king's household in kind ,- and the
sheriff of each county was allowed for these supplies after a fixed
valuation when he accounted at the Exchequer. This arrangement
broke down, (a) because the king wanted payment in money rather
than in kind, (b) because, like all systems of direct purveyance, it was
a burdensome form of taxation. For it was substituted a system
under which payments in money through the sheriff were sub-
stituted for direct payments in kind, and the sarms of the counties
came into existence. If for ‘ came into existence ’ we substitute the
words ‘ were revised ' the account here given is probable enough.

l. 14. in veteribus annalibus rotulis. The expression
‘ad scalam' does not occur in the Pipe Roll of 31 Hen. 1, see
Introduction, p. 36, n. 3. It should be observed that the roll of 31
Hen. I was not unique at the time of the Dialogus.

l. 19. Nescit . . . gratia. This is not from the Vulgate‚ in
spite of the ‘ quod scriptum est.' Its source is unknown to us.

manuscript authority. ‘ Tradux,’ classically‚ is a shoot of vine. In
its mediaeval sense it implies the corporeal continuity of father and
