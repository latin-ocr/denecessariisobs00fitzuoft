220 DE SCACCARIO

P. 130, l. 15. Quod si non extaret breue. There must be a
writ specifying the sum to justify the entry in the Pipe Roll. The in-
consistency between this strictness and the rule as to allowances to
barons of the Exchequer (Ι. viii. D. above) appears not to have
struck the author of this treatise. (For instances of writs of
allowance cf. Madox, H. E. xiiii. ξ 17, p. 673.)

l. 30. expressa . . . non nocent. Dig. lib. 50, tit. xvii, cap.
195.

P. 131, 1. 11. qui lege . . . subuenit. This seems to be a
reminiscence of the Civil Law. Dig. lib. 22, tit. 6, cap. 7 ‘Iuris
ignorantia non prodest adquirere volentibus, Suum vero petentibus
non nocet.'

1. 16. iota mutare. Cf. Matt. v. 18 ‘iota vnum, aut vnus
apex non praeteribit a lege.’

l. 28. ex consequentibus. Cf. ΙΙ. xxvii. B. below.

1. 29. ‘de corpore comitatus! The account of the ‘cor-
pus comitatus' extends from ΙΙ. iv. E. above to this point, and is
resumed in II. xxvii. B. below. See Introduction, pp. 48-51.

l. 35. de veteri firma. For the practice here described see
Pipe Roll 21 Henry ΙΙ. Oafirdslzz're, p. 10. Here it will be
noticed that Adam de Catmera the old sheriff accounts for the old
farm after the account of the new farm has been rendered by Alard
Banastre‚ the new sheriff ς in Dorsel and Somersel, p. 21, where
Aluredus de Lincolnia is continued in office, he renders account of
the old farm first and afterwards of the new farm. The object is
that the sheriff may not get a quittance for his new farm until he
has made up the arrears. As to the summons to the old sheriff
cf. ΙΙ. ii. above.

P. 132, l. 10. de excidentibus et occupatis. Occupala is a
reminiscence of the ‘ius occupantis ’ of the civil law; cf. Digest, 41.
tit. 1, cap. 3 : but the things occupied here are not ‘ res nullius' but
the king's ; and the occupatiori constitutes a purpresture, which
may be committed by building a house forward into the street, or
by cultivating the forest, or by encroaching on the king's land in
any other way. Excz'dentz'a for escaele seems only an attempt at
a classical formation. For a further discussion of the question of
‘purprestures' see Glanvill, ix. c. 11, where also the investigation
of thern is stated to be partos the duty of the Justices in Eyre. See
also for the Exchequer practice here described Pipe Roll 1 Ric. I.
p. 142.
