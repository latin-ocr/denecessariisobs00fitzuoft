16 INTRODUCTION

at the date of the Dialogus the Chancellor had ceased to be con·-
tinually present at the sittings of the Exchequer¹‚ and it is clear
that his duty of acting as a check on the Treasurer might be
deputed to his clerk ². The holders of the office of Chancellor in
the first two-thirds of the reign of Henry II were Thomas Becket
(1154—1162) and Ralph de Varneville (1173-80). From 1162 to
1173 Geoffrey Ridel seems to have been Keeper of the Seal.

The principal member of the Chancery staff, who attended at the
Exchequer by virtue of his office, was the ‘ clericus qui preest scrip-
torio⁸.' He is apparently the same officer as the one described in the
‘ Constitutio' as ‘ Magister Scriptorii.’ This office clearly grew in
importance during its tenure by Robert de Sigillo in the reign of
Henry Ι. At the Exchequer its duties seem not to have been per-
sonal. Its holder, it is true, appointed the Chancellor's scribe4, and
was responsible for his performance of the duties of his office;
but there is> nothing to show that his ‘infinite labours' had any
other connexion with the Exchequer. It is, indeed, probable that
he ceased to attend there soon after the date of the Dialogus ⁵.

The third and most important member of the Chancery staff at
the Exchequer was the Chancellor's clerk‚ though he did not serve
‘ proprio nomine‚' like the officers just mentioned ⁶. He was the
Chancellor’s deputy, and presumably did not sit ‘ex officio.' His
business was to ⁷ act as a check on the Treasurer in place of the
Chancellor. He watched over the writing of the Pipe Roll and
Chancellor's Roll, and saw that they agreed and that they were
consistent with the Roll of the previous year. He also charged the
Sheriff with the debts which were not a part of the ‘ Corpus Corni—
tatus‚' and was responsible for the preparation, the sealing, and the
delivery of the summons in which such debts were recited. Besides
this, he determined the form of the writs issued at the Exchequer‚
and kept duplicates of them, though it does not clearly appear that
he sealed them ⁸. When he acquired the power of taking the

⁵ Professor Liebermann is inclined to infer from the remark ‘quod norunt
qui hec ipsa rerum experientia didicerunt’ that Richard Fitz-Neal held this
office before his appointment as Treasurer‚ Einl. p. 33, n. 2. About 16 Henry ΙΙ
Adam de Gernemue appears to have held it. See Walter Map, De A'ugis
