l. 12. operationes ‚· for the works carried out by the Sheriffs
see II. viii below.

1. 14. camera curie: that is, the King’s private household.
This department is in some ways a rival to the Exchequer and
independent of it. Payments made to the Camera escape all audit,
nor are any accounts rendered by the officers in charge of the
Camera. Its later history is connected with that of the Wardrobe,
but even when the keeper of the Wardrobe was brought under the
control of the Exchequer‚ the Camera continued independent. In
consequence very little is known of its history. See Pipe Roll 1 1
Henry ΙΙ, p. 4 ‘ Willelmus de Casneto debet cccxix. lz'. ix. s. viii. d.
blancas de veteri firma de Norfolchia. Et cl. [ι’. de cremento
comitatu53 sed fuit attornatus inde Isaac Iudaeo per rotulum
camere et per rotulum archidiaconi.’ Here William answers the
summons of the Exchequer by producing an order from the
Camera to pay the sum to Isaac the Jew. See also the case of
the Viscountess of Rouen, ibid. p. 45; and Madox, Η. Ε. viii.

l. 25. Plures sunt. Cf. Glanvill 1, xi seqq. on the whole
question of essoins.

l. 30. sacramento corporaliter prestito. Cf. II. xii. C
below. The use of corporaliter in both passages seems to dispose
of Madox's doubt as to the identity of fides and sacramentum
(H. E. xxiii, ξ 6, p. 662). The usual formula is ‘sacris euangeliis
corporaliter tactis' and the expressions ‘his corporal oath’ and
‘ bodily oath' lasted until the seventeenth century. The ‘Black
Book of the Exchequer ' contains drawings of the Evangelists which
are supposed to have been used for this purpose, though no doubt
in most cases an ‘Euangeliarium’ was employed (cf. Ducange,
s. v. Iuramentum ξ Iurare sacramento Catholicae fidei).

1. 31. Quod si vicecomes. The appointment of attorneys is
here treated in two parts (1) The appointment of attorneys to make
a'Profer on account of the Sheriff. In this case it is only necessary
for him to send two persons, one of whom must be a layman, to
make his proffer sor him ; provided, that is, that he has a sufficient
excuse sor not appearing in person (cf. Madox, H. E. xxiii. § 2,
p. 646 and note p.).

(2) In case, however, the Sherifl‘ has to account, the rule is more
