24 INTRODUCTION

The usher has a deputy in the Common Bench¹ and not in the
King's Bench. The marshal, on the other hand, had his deputies
both in the Exchequer and in the King’s Bench 2; but the marshal
of the Common Bench was a deputy of the marshal of the
Exchequer. A few words must suffic-e for the devolution of the
office os usher. From 1156 to 1167 it was held by Roger of
Wallingford. His successor was Elias, who seems to have held
the office as guardian³ of the widow and heirs of Roger; he
retained the office until 1191, when Laurence, presumably the son
of Roger, became usher ; and the office continued in the family
of de ScaccariO, as it grew to be called, until 1304, when it was
divided between coheiresses ⁴.

The office of usher of the Receipt seems to have become
separated at some time from that of usher of the Exchequer, since
in 18 Edward 1 Adam de Stratton5 held a moiety of it, which he
presumably acquired by purchase.

The remaining department of the king’s Household is that of
the constables. Their number is not specified, nor whether, as is
probable, they served in turn. If so we may regard the constable
on duty with 55. a day salary as the head of the department, having
under him John, the chief marshal, with a salary of 2s. a day.
The chief marshal thus holds a position like that of William Δ
Mauduit in the Chamber, or the Keeper of the Seal in the Chancery.
The constables’ department includes the whole outdoor staff of
the Household, especially those who have to do with horses or
hunting. The marshal has the special duty of witnessing all
expenditure by the king's officials, and keeps account by means
of tallies (dicas) both of payments out of the Treasury and Chamber
and of other expenditure ⁶. This right of general supervision may
be the ‘Magisterium in Curia Regis de Liberatione Prebende’
sor which John the Marshal owed forty marks of silver in
31 Henry I ⁷.

In the Exchequer the staff of this department consists of the
constable ⁸, his clerk ⁹, and the marshal ¹⁰. Their functions in the
Exchequer resemble their functions in the Household. These three
form an independent court for the purpose of paying all soldiers
