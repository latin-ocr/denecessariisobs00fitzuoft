only being in the middle of the obverse of the tally‚ instead of
near the end. The gold penny is distinguished from the silver by
the cut being made perpendicular to the surface of the tally instead
of obliquely.

P. 75, l. 12. m’si oui rex vel iusticia mandauerit. The
‘ calculator’s ’ duty seems to have fallen to the ‘ Marshal of the Ex-
chequer’ at a later date. See Spelman, s. v. Marescallus.

l. 16. secundum consuetum, ‘according to the usual course
of the Exchequer, not by the rules of arithmetic.' The oppositiou
is between the old methods of the abacus and those of the newer
Arabian arithmetic. See Introduction, pp. 38 seq.

l. 31. obulum aureum. This use of gold and silver half-
pence is clearly more primitive than Recorde’s plan of placing
counters above the line (Introduction, p. 40). The change was
presumably made after the reign of John ; cf. Madox, H. E. xxiii.
ξ 29, p. 711. An allusion to such counters has been traced in
Fitz-Stephen's notice of John the Marshal ‘ Erat siquidem Iohannes
ille cum thesaurariis et caeteris fiscalis pecuniae et publici aeris
receptoribus Londoniae, ad quadrangulam tabulam, quae dicitur
“Calculis bicoloribus,’' vulgo Scaccart‘um ς potius autem est regis
tabula nummis albicoloribus3 ubi etiam placita coronae regis
tractantur' (Becket Matermls, iii. p. 51). But ‘tabula Calculis
bicoloribus ’ is merely a ‘ classical’ equivalent for Scaccarz'um, and
the Calculi, the red and white pieces, are contrasted with the silver
coins. Compare however J. H. Round, Commune of Zonaion,
p. 63.

P. 76, l. 8. in agendis vicecomitis: sc. II. xxvii. B. C.‚ below.

1. 14. nuno vnum: sc. denarium. The ‘nummum ' in the
received text seems a needless conjecture.

l. 16. quibusdam tamen appositis, ‘under certain condi-
tions.' The conditions are separable accidents which may be added
or removed at the will of the ‘ calculator!
