INTRODUCTION 39

Two things strike one at once: in this system of arithmetic there
is no zer0, and its place is supplied by a system of columns. Now
this is the system of the abacus¹; and to save trouble we shall
in future speak of the exchequer in its arithmetical sense as the
abacus. This distinction between the arithmetic of the Arabians
and the system of the abacus was profound. There is in the
Dialogus one allusion to Arabian arithmetic ², contrasting it with
the system of the abacus, but the contrast is obscured by the fact
that the only operations employed in the Exchequer were those of
addition and subtraction ³. It is not needful to discuss here the
origin and history of the arithmetic of the abacus ⁴, especially as in
some particulars the methods of the exchequer were peculiar to
itself. The earlier abacists seem to have used pieces, each bearing
a mark signifying one of the nine digits, to place in the columns of
their abacus. At the Exchequer the calculator employs a device
known as ‘ acervi numerales ⁵.' The nature of these we shall now
consider ⁶. The earliest description of the system will be found in
‘ The ground of Artes, teaching the work and practice of Arith-
metic,’ published in 1543 by Robert Recorde. In this book three
methods of reckoning by counters are described. The first system
deals with arithmetic of numbers, and does not concern us. The
second system is called the ‘merchant’s use‚' and may be briefiy
described. The counters are arranged in rows, the pence nearest
to the operator; above them the shillings, then the pounds, then
scores of pounds, then hundreds, and so on. For the pence, 6d.
is indicated by a counter placed above the line, and the remaining
units by counters on the line. For the shillings‚ 105. is indicated
by a counter above the line, 5s. by a counter on the line, but to the
left hand of the units‚ and the units by counters grouped on the
line. The pounds and scores of pounds are treated in the same

¹ The ordinary columns of the abacus were for the units‚ tem, hundreds, &c.‚
of common numbers. It was necessary to adapt it to the computation of
money. Cf. Littre'‚ s.v. Echz'quier.

² Dialogus, 1. v. L, ‘ secundum consuetum cursum scaccarii non legibus
arithmeticis.’

³ Division on the abacus was a formidable process. If the divisor were
above 5, e. g. 7, the quotient was obtained by continually dividing the dividend
by 10 and multiplying it by 3, and adding all the subsidiary quotients obtained by
the successive divisions by 10. See Chasles, Hist. Geom. (1837) pp. 464 seqq.
