236 DE scACCARIO

P. 154, 1. 33. venalem . . . iusticiam. For the phrase cf. Cic.
in Verr. ii. 119 ‘ Venalem in Sicilia iurisdietionem habuit!

vt sine dilatione fiat: cf. P. R. 15 Hen. ΙΙ, Vorkslzz're,
p. 36 ‘ Ricardus de Rue reddit compotum de 5 marcis pro
festinando iure suo contra Michaelem de Furneis. In thesauro
11s. et debet 555. et Sd) There was still 275. 8d. of this sum
owing in 21 Hen. Π.

P. 155, 1. 3. obstantibus interdum. The holders of land
also paid fines to avoid being impleaded (see Madox, H. E. xii. ξ 4, .
p. 309). The clause of sllagna Carta (cap. 49), ‘ Nulli vendemus,
nulli negabimus, aut differemus rectum vel iustitiam,' includes both
the practices here described (cf. Madox, loc. cit. ξ 6, p. 314).

l. 10. rectum nondum habuerunt. Cf. P. R. 1171 (17
Hen. ΙΙ) p. 21 H'ilts.; ‘ Willelmus de Anesia debet 10 marcas pro
recto terre quam Willelmus de Coleuilla tenet. Set nondum habuit
rectum.⁵ He had not been able to get his case tried, and decided
sor or against him. Note that ‘rectum ’ and ‘iusticia’ are equivalent
terms, but compare preceding note on ‘in spem vero! So also
P. R. (1190) 1 Ric. Ι, p. 413 ‘Bartholomeus de Crec debet 20
marcas pro recto de Sudflet. Set mortuus est et non habuit
rectum licet multum institisset?

l. 18. Solet tamen. This abatement is specially provided
against in a case from the Pipe Roll of 10 Ric. Ι, Rot. 2. b.
Sudhanlescz‘ra ; ‘ Henricus de Brunden debet 10 marcas pro habendo
breui de Morte Antecessoris de Gaiola Wintonie cum pertinentiis
coram H. C antuariensi Archiepiscopo ; tali conditione, quod si
amiserit ius suum, dabit 10 marcas' (Madox, H. E. xii. ξ 2, p. 298,
note d). A similar practice, that of offering a certain proportion of
the sum to be recovered, is described by Madox (loc. cit. § 5, p. 31 1).
The result of this and last paragraph is that a litigant pays to have
justice, and the payment is not due until the case is decided for or

against him 3 if he wins or does not go to the trial, when he might, ·

he will have to pay ; if he loses, the King will probably let him off.

l. 22. tertii generis. Reliefs do not fit into the classification
of all payments as either ‘pene pecuniarie' or ‘sponte oblata!
They differ from the latter, first, because the lord is bound to
receive the homage and accept the relies of the tenant (Glanvill,
IX. i. 1), and secondly, because the tenant would in most cases be in
possession of the estate before relief became due, and the lord's
remedy for neglect to pay relies is by distress (Glanvill, IX. viii. 4)
