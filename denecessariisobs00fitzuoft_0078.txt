48 INTRODUCTION

The sheriff‚ on receiving the summons, collects the debts
mentioned in it, if necessary by distress1, except in the case of
debts due from tenants-in-chief, who have the privilege of deferring
payment till the meeting of the Exchequer ². In such cases the
sheriff must obtain the promise of the lord or his steward to hold

him harmless‚ and such promise must be given in full county
court ³.

On the day after Low Sunday‚ or the day after Michaelmas, as
the case may be, the sheriff must appear at the Exchequer in
person or in certain cases by deputy ⁴ ; and in either case he must
pay in the money demanded, or produce vouchers to the same
amount ⁵. He presents himself before the Barons on his arrival ⁵,
and attends every morning until his account can be taken. On
making his payment in the Receipt he will receive a memoranda
tally of the sum paid in on account of his farm if it is payable
blanch ⁷, and ordinary tallies for the debts he has levied. His next
business is to have his payment on account of farm blanched ⁸,
before which his account cannot be taken. A day will then be
given him for the account.

In Easter Term no formal account is taken ⁹, but only what is
termed a View of Account. The sheriff is examined as to how
much he has paid in on account, and what debts he has been
unable to levy. No entries are made on the roll, but notes are
taken by the Treasurer's clerk, and any points of importance
are reserved for the discussion of the Barons at the close of the
Exchequer. The sheriff receives a provisional discharge and the
actual account is held over till Michaelmas.

At Michaelmas (if not at Easter also) the sheriff is bound to
give notice on the day of his account or the day before in the town
where the Exchequer is held, so that any debtor on whose behalf
he appears may be present if he pleases ¹⁰. The other sheriffs are
excluded, and the Treasurer formally demands if the sheriff is ready
to account. He then asks if the customary outgoings (alms,
annual payments, lands granted out) are the same as the year
before. If so, the writer of the Great Roll, at the Treasurer’s
dictation ¹¹, sets down the name of the sheriff and of the county for
which he accounts and leaves a blank for the sum which he has
