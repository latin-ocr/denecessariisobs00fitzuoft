228 DE SCACCARIO

‘aeftrigelt' with Liebermann, Ueber die Leges Egfl pp. 28, 103),
which show the existence of the custom in other cases.

P. 140, 1. 19. proprium not ‘his own’ thies, but the thief who
has stolen his goods.

P. 141, 1. 5. iuxta promissum: cf. Ι. ν. 1 above, to which
this passage appears to refer. No actual promise to deal with the
subject is given, but the second book follows the plan of the writing
of the roll described in that passage.

l. 9. sequitur compotus de censu nemorum. A eom-
parison of Ι. v. Ι above shows that the author has here omitted to
mention the accounts ‘de omnibus firmis maneriorum . . . que
annuatim debentur et soluuntur.’ These are the manors which are
in the King’s hand but do not form a part of the Corpus Comitatus.
Here also corne the boroughs, unless their accounts are large enough
to require separate treatment.

l. 14. Sunt tamen quedam foreste. In the Pipe Roll of
14 Henry II we find the forest of Northamptonshire (census fizo)
paying tithes to Lincoln, that of Windsor (fi13) to Salisbury,
Graveley (fi 1 10s.) and Chippenham (E. 3) to Salisbury, Cornbury
(fi 7) to Lincoln, Malvern (fi 3) to Tewkesbury, and the New
Forest (2525) to Salisbury. Those of Scaleby in Yorkshire (24),
Cnot (i. e. Cannock) in Staffordshire (ἑὸ 135. 4d.), Cumberland
(ἑὸ 135. 4d.), Dene (ξω), Feckenham (2520), Nottingham (fizo),
Stanton in Oxfordshire (fig), Westbury (ia), and the wood of
Orcop in Herefordshire apparently pay no tithes. In the Pipe
Roll of 21 Hen. II Galtres (fi5) and Scarborough (fiz 13s. 4d.)
are added to the list, and do not pay tsthe, and Malvern does not
appear. For ‘ maiores ecclesie ’ see Ι. iii. F above and note.

l. 20. illiciti: cf. Ι. xi. G above and note ; also Liebermann,
Einledung, p. 62.

1. 28. vt vianti animo. ‘ quanti‚' which Madox reads, has
no manuscript support. The allusion may be to Hab. ii. 2 ‘ Scribe
visum, et explana eum super tabulas, ut percurrat qui legerit eum!

P. 142, l. 3. Prenotatio fit. For instance, cf. Pipe Roll 21
Henry ΙΙ, p. 141 :—

et Hugonem de Cressi :
