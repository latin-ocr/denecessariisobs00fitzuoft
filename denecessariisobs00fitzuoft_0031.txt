cantion, e. g. on points of law and in his account of the assay as
practised at the Exchequer. Further‚ on points of official privilege
his testimony cannot be accepted as disinterested. Mostly, however,
it is independently confirmed by records. His reticence on the
privileges of the clergy is especially noticeable. When the canon
law and the law of the realm come into collision, as for instance
when a clerk becomes surety for a debt and is liable to imprison-
ment, he contents himself with commenting on the impropriety of
the situation. Speaking generally, it seems proper to attach a very
high value to his unchecked evidence, but not to accept it without
reserve.

Tffl: ORIGJN OF THE EXCHEQUER.

The question we now have to consider is not the origin osa central
department of finance, but the origin of the Exchequer as described
in the Dialogus. A government without a financial department
seems most unlikely; and we may therefore assume as a starting
point that both the Dukes of Normandy and the Anglo-Saxon
kings had their departments of finance ¹, and that the same holds
good of William I and William II as kings of England. But, grant-
ing these assumptions‚ the question remains, from which of the two
sources, Normandy or England, did the Exchequer of Henry II
dei-ive its characteristics? If we analyse that institution, it will
appear that the investigation can be divided into three branches:
(1) the staff and constitution of the Exchequer, (2) the monetary
system employed therein, and (3) the arithmetic in use. If we
find all three traceable back to Saxon times, we must assume that
William the Conqueror simply took over the system of Edward the
Confessor ; if not, we may suppose that more or less importation
from Normandy took place.

Beginning with the staff and constitution of the Exchequer, we
may say at once that our studies lead to the conclusion that the
staff of the Exchequer is, with some exceptions, the staff of the
king's household put to financial tasks and slightly influenced by
their duties. To establish this we shall start with the ‘ Constitutio

¹ The Norman financial department was fully organized in 1130. See
Bemard the Scribe, E. H. R. XIV. 427, by J. H. Round. Cf. Cal. Documents
relating to France, No. 1588. For the Anglo—Saxon kings the History of
Danegeld is conclusive, For William Ι cf. Wz'nton Domesday, s. 9 b; Domes-
day, 1. 49, which mentions Henry the Treasurer‚ who may even have been
treasurer before the Conquest.
