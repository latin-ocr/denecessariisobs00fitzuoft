172 DE scAccARIO

the archbishopric ; and though the nature of this proceeding is not
clear, it rather resembles a financial than a legal transaction.

P. 67, l. 17. lieet alicui contradicere: cf. P. R. 21 Hen. ΙΙ,
p. 47 ‘ Petrus filius Ade et alii iuratores eiusdem burgi (i. e.
Northampton) reddunt compotum de 30 marcis quia contradixe-
runt recordo Curie Regis. In thesauro liberavit. Et Quietus est.'

1. 18. propter regie, ‘on account of the excellence of the
king’s image which is indivisible from his seal in the treasury.' The
passage only means that the seal has a portrait of the king on it.

l. 31. siue de clero. For this distinction of clerks and
laymen see below, Ι. viii. A, II. xxviii. A, and compare Intro·
duction, p. 19.

P. 68, l. 1. suppositis, ‘placing underneath' ; cf. below, 11.
xxvii. C, and Introduction, pp. 50 seq.

l. 8. Dubiorum . . . vel dubitalium, ‘doubtful or partially
doubtful points.' Dubz'talz'a seems to be formed on the analogy of
sacramentalia, which are defined as things partaking of the nature
of sacraments but not sacraments3 e. g. holy water, blessed bread,
&c. The phrase ‘ sacramenta et sacramentalia ' would be familiar to
the author as a bishop.

l. 20. Hoc tamen. He may issue the king's writ under his
own testimony, i. e. a writ beginning ‘ Henricus Rex,' &c., and ending
‘ Teste Robe1to Comite Leicestrie'3 or he may choose the other
style and make his writ begin ‘ Robertus eomes Leicestrie’ and end
⁴ Testibus Ricardo Thesaurario et Willelmo de Sancte Marie
Ecclesia.' For a specimen of each kind see Madox, Exchequer, x.
§ 13. n. p. 268; and Pipe Roll Society, X, Ancient Charters‚ ed.
Round, p. 96: cf. also Ι. vi. B, below.

l. 27. vbi est. Matt. vi. 21.

l. 35. vt noueris: see Introduction, pp. 46 seq„ for an account
of the arrangement of the seats at the Exchequer table.

P. 69, 1. 6. miles gregarius. The endeavour of the author
to find a dignified and classica] title for .the important official
‘quern constabularium dicimus: has led him into error. ‘Miles
gregarius ' in its strict sense is a common soldier, one of the flock,
not, as our author seems to have supposed, the chief soldier of the
flock. Possibly he was misled by analogy, constabularius means
the leader of a constabularz‘a, and so gregarius ought to mean
the leader of a grex, or stabulum may have suggested grex.

l. 14. recautis: a civil law term, ‘quittance' or ‘release'
