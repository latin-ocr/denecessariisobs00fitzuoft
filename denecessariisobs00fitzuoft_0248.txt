184 DE SCACCARIO

A, above, and note. The clerk of the constabulary takes the con·
lrabreuz'a into the Exchequer at the terms of the Exchequer, i. e. at
Easter and Michaelmas at the beginning of each session.

P. 84, 1. 16. quia propter: there is no authority for the
reading quapropter maiores given by Madox. The sense is that
neither the clerk of the constabulary nor the chancellor can always
attend at the Exchequer, because of more important duties which
keep them near the king.

l. 31. non estimetur . . . inum: cf. Baruch iii. 36 ‘non
aestimabitur alius aduersus eum.'

l. 33. magni regis Siculi curia. Roget ΙΙ of Sicily, who was
succeeded in 1154 by William the Wicked, appears to have
encouraged the residence of Englishmen at his court. John of
Salisbury, in a letter to Peter abbot of Celle‚ alludes to the Greek
wine: ‘quo me Siculus cancellarius ad perniciem salutisque dis-
pendium potare consueuerat ’ (Ep. lxxv. c. 72. C, ed. Migne).

l. 34. Surrexit interea . . . illum: cf. Exodus i. 8 ‘ Surrexit
interea rex nouus super Aegyptum qui ignorabat Ioseph!

l. 36. latera is difficult. Probably ‘ companions.' The passage
reads like a quotation, but we cannot trace it.

P. 85, l. 4. cum fama: translate ‘since bare rumour is less
than the very truth'; the reading ‘cui' is destitute of all manu-
script support, and the indicative mood is not decisive against
‘eum.' The sense is that the offers of other princes were ‘ fama,'
those of Henry ‘ veritas ipsa.’ Compare however Ι. ν. Q, above.

l. 26. cujus supra meminimus: sc. I. iii. D, E.

1. 28. in scaccario, ‘on the Exchequer table.’ On all this
passage see Introduction, pp. 28 seqq.

1. 30. vt ponderi respondeant: translate ‘that they may
correspond to their proper weight’ ς there must be no selection of
light or heavy pieces as might occur if there were no mixture made.

1. 34. libram vnam. The pound is not a pound weight,
but 240 actual pence.

P. 86, 1. 6. prestolatur aduentum: cf. Iudic. ix. 25 ‘dum
illius praestolabantur aduentum.'

1. 10. vasculum ignitorum cinerum: a cupel or test
made of wood ashes. Like the bone-ash cupels used in modern
assaying, these porous vessels absorbed the litharge which ran off
from the melting silver. See Introduction, p. 30.

l. 26. si vicecomes cuius est. An instance is quoted by
