NOTES 235

p. 107 ‚· ‘ Burgenses de Bedesord reddunt compotum de 40
marcis pro Carta Regis habenda, ut sint in Libertate Burgensium
de Oxineford. In thesauro 30 marcas, et debent 10 marcas':
numerous other instances are quoted by Madox, H. E. xi. ξ 2,
p. 273. On the whole class of ‘ oblata in rem ’ see Madox, op. cit.
xi and xiii.

P. 154, 1. 10. vel pro custodia cuiusque: cf. P. R. 8 Ric. Ι,
rot. 4 α, Warewz'c et Lez'rceslerscira. ‘ Henricus de Wichenton debet
60 marcas pro habenda custodia et donatione filie Philippi de
Niewebote cum hereditate sua,’ etc. (quoted by Madox, H. E.
v. § 2, p. 136, note w).

1. 17. quamdiu soluendo fuerint: the payment was usually
made in instalments‚ or in some cases may have been a yearly
fixed sum.

l. 19. careant impetratis. Madox (H. E. xi. § 2, p. 273)
quotes a charter of King John to the abbot of Bec from the Charter
Roll of 5 John m. 14, with the following marginal note; ‘Carta
Abbatis de Becco, Et notandum quod hec Carta scripta fuit et
sigillata in Normannia anno regni Regis quart0,· sed liberata fuit
anno quinto, eo quod Abbas prius non habuit denarios ad quie-
tandum Castam istam! Cf. also Pipe Roll, 3 John, rot. 2 b. Lz'nc.
‘ Henricus filius Hugonis de Neuill reddit compotum de 15 marcis
et uno palefrido, pro habenda saisina terre unde dissaisitus fuit,
(ο quod non Obseruauit terminos finis sui' (quoted by Madox,
H. E. xxiii. ξ 18, p. 679, note w). ‘Manente scaccario’: i. e.
before the close of the session,

1. 27. ad quodlibet scaccarium. This was known as
‘Attermination‚’ on which see Madox, H. E. xxiii. § 18, p. 678,
and the cases there quoted.

1. 30. In spem vero. On fines for legal proceedings see
Madox‚ H. E. xii. The argument of this paragraph is regarded
by Lieberrnann (Ez'nl. p. 60) as sophistical. The author in the
same breath denies that justice is sold, and admits that ‘procedural
advantages' are for sale. The suitor pays to have his case heard
quickly and by the best judges he can get (cf. Pollock and Mait-
land, i. 342) 3 he may even make his payment conditional on
winning, a serious abuse. Care must be taken to avoid regarding
1'ustz‘cz’a as meaning ‘a favourable verdict.' In the abstract it
means ‘ justice‚’ in the concrete ‘ a fair trial‚' and in this passage
the meaning fluctuates between the two senses.
