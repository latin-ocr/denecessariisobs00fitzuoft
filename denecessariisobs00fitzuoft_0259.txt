planation of the settlement made after the Conquest. It is not
historica] in form, but rather a legal theory of the history of the
changes then made. According to this view all the English land-
holders who had actually resisted William, lost their lands at once
and for ever, a statement which facts recorded in Domesday show
to be very probable ; those who had not taken part in that resis-
tance <the great majority) remained in possession of their lands,
but found themselves mere holders at will under foreign lords with
no inheritable interest. Evictions of these precarious tenants pro-
duced a royal decree giving them a new title enforceable against
their lords and recognizing two classes of tenure, viz. tenure by the
favour of the lord, meritis engrenlz'bus, and tenure under a contram,
> interueniente pactione. Now it is clear that this passage is not
applicable to tenants in chief, and that it does not refer to the
process by which men ‘ bought’ their lands from William (Α. S.
Chronicle, a0 1066): but that it describes the establishment of legal
relations between the lord and under-tenant by royal authority.
A close parallel will, however, be found in the famous passage in
Bracton f. 7b, where he discusses, not the condition of English
landowners after the conquest, but that of certain tenants within
manors of royal demesne. Bracton tells much the same story;
these tenants, free at the conquest, were ejected by their new
lords, restored in a worse condition, and provided by the crown
with a legal remedy. These tenants also were of two kinds, those
who held with a special agreement, and those who had none.
Bracton’s account, again, is a legal theory of history rather than
history. The problem suggested by this parallel is double; firstly‚
are the two authors thinking of the same set of facts ? and secondly,
was Bracton acquainted with this passage? The second question
is one for commentators on Bracton; but in answer to the first it
may be pointed out that it is almost incredible that a theory which
Bracton applies to an exceptional class of small holders on the
royal demesne can be equally applicable when extended to every
landholder in the country. It may be suggested that the Dialogus
has set out to tell one story and ended by telling another. Another
and apocryphal version of the story will be found in the passage
quoted by Wilkins (Leges Anglo-Saxonzzaa p. 286) from a manu-
script pedigree of the Sharneborne family, subsequently printed by
Gibson in his Reliquiae Spelmannz‘anae. Here it is asserted that
the Conqueror ordered such tenants to be called ‘ Drengs ' [a Danish
