Introduction, p. 33. ,

Ρ. 126, l. 32. de prestito regis. Cf. P. R. 7 Hen. 11
Glouceslerslzz're ‘ Et Waltero Blundo 20 s numero in Aura de prestito
Regis.’ This allowance was continued till 17 Hen. II when Walter
Blundus presumably died. The entry for that year is ‘ Et Waltero
filio Walteri blundi 20 s numero in Aura per breue Regis de prestito
Regis? Walter’s son therefore received this allowance not as
Walter's heir but by virtue of a new writ. In 1 Richard I he was
still receiving the allowance ‘ hoc anno.’ The technical word ‘ prae-
stitum' must not be pressed here3 the payment is not an imprest
sor which the person to whom it was paid is accountable <Madox,
H. E. x. ξ 13, p. 266). It merely means a grant, and implies that
the grant is during pleasure.

P. 127, 1. 5. Liberationum . . . indigentium. Many in-
stances of this will be found on the printed Pipe Rolls. The
account of allowances usually begins with items of fir 10s. 5d. i. e.
a penny a day to some pensioner or other, e. g. ‘Et Turstino In-
firmo' 305. 5d. (P. R. 14 Hen. II Essex, p. 35), cf. Madox, H. E.
x. ξ 9, pp. 238 sq. It appears that the number of pensioners was
not frequently altered, but that when one died his pension was
given to another.

l. 7. Quedam . . . seruientum. Numerous payments to
servants will be found on the Pipe Rolls. Thomas Brunus had
fivepence a day out of the farm of Hereford (P. R. 14 Hen. ΙΙ,
p. 114). The farm of London was charged with several of these
paymentS. William Fitz Otho, the King’s goldsmith‚ had a shilling
a day. The keeper of the palace of Westminster sevenpence a
day. Henry Arborarius fivepence a day, and so forth (P. R. 2
Hen. ΙΙ, p. 3). Cf. Madox, H. E. x. ξ 12, p. 249, note n.

l. 9. luporum comprehensores. Instances are quoted by
Madox (Dt'al., p. 42, note bb) of such payments out of the farm of
Worcestershire in the reigns of Henry 11 and John, the payment
being 35. in each case. (Cf. also P. R. 7 Hen. ΙΙ. Nott. and Derb.
p. 30.) This payment seems to have ceased in the reign of
Henry 111.

l. 12. Et nota. The passage bracketed reads like the note
of an interested official. The Pipe Rolls give no support to the
assertion.

l. 17. si quid . . . constituta. Such payments were made
