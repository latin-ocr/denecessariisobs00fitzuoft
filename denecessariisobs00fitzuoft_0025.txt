INTRODUCTION 9

None of the four earliest MSS. has any contemporary title or any
hint as to the author's name.

Itis not easy to understand how this treatise came to be attributed
to Gervase of Tilbury. Madox (p. vii) only tells us that it had
passed under that name for many years, for what reason he did not
know. He proceeds to show that Gervase of Tilbury cannot be
identified with Gervase de Thesauro, who was an officer of the
Receipt of the Exchequer in the early years of Henry ΙΙ. It is,
however, improbable that the mistake arose from any such
identification or confusion. The most probable explanation is that
the work called Trz‘columnis, which the author of the Dialogus
speaks of as his own, has in some way been confused with the
Historia T rz’parlila of Gervase of Tilbury. But even so slender a
thread of connexion is scarcely necessary. Coke <Fz‘rst Inst. p. 13),
who quotes the Dialogus repeatedly‚ refers to the author as ‘ Ockam.'
Now as Coke knew the date of the treatise, and ought to have
known the date of William of Ockharn, it was a bad blunder to
have confused the two. Supposing Coke to be merely quoting the
title of the MS. which he used, we must regard the original
attribution of that MS. as purely arbitrary. It would be possible
to quote instances from the history of English MSS. of equally
unwarranted fathering of books on famous names.

But there is no difficulty in assigning the treatise to its true
author, and Madox has the credit of first establishing the fact that
the writer of the treatise was Richard, Bishop of London, basing
his argument upon the assertion of Alexander de Swereford in the
Red Book of the Exchequer ¹. It is not intended in this introduc·-
tion to deal at length with the life of the author. It is sufficient to
point out that Richard was the son² of Nigel, Bishop of Ely, who
was himself the nephew or son of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury‚ and
the brother of Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. All these men
belonged at once to the hierarchy of the Church and of the
administration. As a member of the family, proud of their name ³,
the repository of an inherited knowledge ⁴, it was natural that he
should wish, like his father, whom he calls the Esdras of the
