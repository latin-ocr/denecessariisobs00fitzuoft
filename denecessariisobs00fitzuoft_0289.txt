NOTES 221

P. 133, l. 8. Porro eschaete dicuntur. The Dialogus
divides escheats under the following heads ε

1. Escheats‚ Lands and goods of tenants in chief dying with-
out heirs.

2. (a) Lands and goods of fugitives from justice.

(b) Goods of those who sailed in the ordeal under the Assize

of Clarendon.

3. Treasure Trove.

4. Goods of Usurers.

Glanvill (VH. c. 17) dealing of escheats in general gives-

1. Lands and goods of persons dying without heirs.

2. Of female wards guilty of unchastity.

3. Of felons and outlaws. The land going to the lord, the
goods and ‘ a year, day and waste of the lands to the king?

The goods of usurers are treated of in the previous chapter.

Glanvill’s classification is more in accordance with actual prac-
tice than that of the Dialogus. Escheats are lands falling to the
king by reason of failure of heirs or by the fault of the tenant. Of
course the author of the Dialogus writes from the point of view of
finance and this accounts for his classification, though the omission
of all reference to ‘ marriage ' is curious. The expression ‘ escaeta
cum herede’ appears to be peculiar to the Dz'alogus; custodia
is the usual term.

l. 22. cetera vero . . . cedunt. A case of ordinary law as
to wardships; cf. Glanvill, vii. 9.§ 3. Glanvill adds that if a ward-
ship is granted by the king with the addition that if the grantee is
not to account at the Exchequer, the grantee may present to
churches and otherwise treat the estate as his own, in other cases
not (Ibid. 10. § 3). Such grants under various conditions will be
found in Madox (H. E. x. § 4, pp. 221 sqq).

l. 2 5. legittime etatis adeptus beneficia, i.e. in the case
of a military tenant on the completion of the twenty-first year, in
that of a sokeman on the completion of the fifteenth‚ and in the
case of a burgess when the boy can count money, measure eloth
and so forth, Glanvill, vii. 9. ξ 2.

1. 29. Ine vel ine. Cf. P. R. 20 Hen. II. p. 30 ‘Hun-
fridus de Bohun debet cc. libras pro releuio terre sue.’ So
also P. R. 22 Hen. ΙΙ. Rot. 5 b ‘ Ricardus Malebisse reddit com·
potum de 1005. pro releuio suo. In thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus
est' ; and other cases quoted by Madox (H. E. x. ξ 4, pp. 216 sqq.).
