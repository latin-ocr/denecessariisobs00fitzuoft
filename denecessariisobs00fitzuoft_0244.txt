1 80 DE SCACCARIO

in the order of filing (cf. Introduction to the Pipe Rolls, P. R. Soc.
vol. 3, p. 52) and from an entry on the roll of 15 Henry II (P. R.
15 H. ΙΙ, Bucks, p. 12). The entry runs as follows ‘ Gillebertus de
Pinkeinni reddit compotum de 259 pro militibus suis modo respe-
cluatz's in Norbanlesz'ra. In thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus est.'
This is on Roll 1, Memb. 1, dorso. The words in italic type are an
addition, and exist on the Pipe Roll alone. The account for
Northamptonshire is on Roll 4, and there is no mention in it of the
aid due from Gilbert.

P. 79, l. 30. in agendis vicecomitis: sc. II. xxvii.C, below.
It is clear that ‘in agendis vicecomitis ¹ refers to the whole of the
second part and not to II. iii, which now bears that title.

P. 80, l. 7. in agendis vicecomitis: sc. Π. ν, below.

l. 12. infra: sc. ΙΙ. vii, below.

l. 19. compoti collocantur. These accounts may or may
not be given in detail: cf. P. R. 14 Hen. 11, London, p. 3 ‘Idem
vicecomes reddit compotum de fi617 et 16s. et 8d. de auxilio
Ciuitatis ad maritandum filiam Regis ; quod consideratione
Baronum ideo summatum est per breue quod vicecomiti libera-
uerunt in thesauro quia particule eiusdem auxilii in uno rotulo
comprehendi non poterant? Compare also P. R. 5 Hen. ΙΙΙ, Rot.
9a. tit. Item Ebor. m. 2 <Madox, ΙΙ. ξ 2. note l. p. 26) ‘ Amercia-
menta facta per Hubertum de Burgo Iusticiarium . . . Debita huius
itineris non sunt in Rotulo sed in pullo‚’ i. e. in an auxiliary roll
known as the ‘ pullus pipae ’: some of these are still in existence.

l. 19. exceptis quibusdam ciuitatibus. The roll 1 Ric. Ι
(in which the system described in the Dialogus is well exemplified)
begins with a sheet called the ‘ Rotulus de Honoribus’ containing
the accounts of sixteen estates at that time in the king’s hands. In
the 'body of the roll there are separate accounts for Waltham,
Colchester, Orford, Lincoln‚ the honour of Tickhill‚ Higham,
Northampton, Benson, the mines of Carlisle, the lands of Hasculf
Musard and Hamo de Masei (in Notts and Derby), Windsor,
Winchester, Southampton, Bosham, the honours of Arundel and
Petworth‚ the land of Ingram de Mustrel (in Surrey), and Dover.
Meons, which has a separate account under Henry 11, is by this
time reduced to a part of the general account for Hampshire.

l. 29. Firmo . . . tantum. This distinction between firma
and census does not always hold good. For instance, in the
Pipe Ron of 15 Henry ΙΙ (p. 30) Richard de Luvetot accounts for
