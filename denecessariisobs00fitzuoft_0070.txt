way. If we now set down in this manner the sum of ιΕ, 198 19s. 1 παῖ’
it will appear as below :—

The next use is the ‘auditor’s use,' i.'e. the use of the Exchequer.
Here the counters are placed in columns, and Recorde points out
that the units are spread over as many lines as the operator may
find convenient. It may be added that they are placed in two rows,
and not more than three in a row. For the pence, a single counter
above the units signifies 6d. 3 in the shillings‚ a single counter
above the units on the right signifies 5, and a single counter on
the left 1o; and the same system applies to the pounds‚ scores of
pounds‚ and so on. We may now set down after the ‘auditor's
use ' the sum of 5198 195. 11d. as before :—

It will be seen, on eomparison, that this scheme almost exactly
coincides with the scheme arrived at by Mr. Hubert Hall in the
paper referred to above. The evidence of actual use of this device
is naturally difficult to discover. It must be sought in the casua}
use of it by accountants, marking the figures of the counters by
dots on the margins of accounts. One such instance is mentioned
by Mr. Hall. Another, of a much earlier date, will be found in the
Cartulary of Stanley Abbey, printed² in the Willslzz're Magazme,
XV. p. 249, which probably dates from the thirteenth century. With-
out insisting that the ‘calculator’ of the Dialogus employed the
‘ auditor’s use ’ exactly as described by Recorde, it may reasonably
be assumed that his ‘ acervi numerales’ were of the same nature.

We may now return to the earliest arithmetica] device employed
at the Exchequer, the tally. As the description in the Dialogus

¹ This is the sum used by Recorde himself.
² By Mr. Walter de Gray Birch. The dots are used to indicate the place

where each deed will be found in the muniment room. The device employed
differs from the use described above.
