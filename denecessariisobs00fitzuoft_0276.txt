212 DE SCACCARIO

of coming to Westminster. Cf. Pollock and Maitland‚ [Ιώ-Ι. qf
Eng. Low, i. p. 181.

P. 120, l. 1. iota vnum mutare: cf. Matt. v. 18 ‘iota vnum
. . . non praeteribit a leges

l. 16. in magno annali rotulo. These items appear in the
sorrn; ‘ De placitis A. Β. et C. D : ' ⁴ E. debet ' tot ‘ pro tali causa.’
Instances will be found in Madox (H. E. iii. ξ 10, p. 83 and
passim) and in the printed Pipe Rolls.

l. 27. sieut dictum est ab initio: cf. Ι. iv. C above.

P. 121, l. 3. Attende igitur. For the remark on style cf.
above I. v. G ‘ siue in scriptis, siue in receptis, siue in taleis, siue in
expensis‚' and note.

l. 9. capitis. It must not be supposed that the Sheriff ran
any risk of being executed. He would probably, when caught, be
committed to the Fleet, until he fined with the King for his
release. In the fifteenth century the Sheriff of Northumberland
frequently does not appear for years successively. Possibly the
author is thinking of the use of ‘caput' in the Civil law. Of
course the offence was technically rebellion. Cases illustrating
the actual practice are quoted by Madox (Η Ε. xxiii. ξ 22, pp.
694 πη)-

l. 18. libera custodia. For a definition of the form os
imprisonment‚ see above Ι. ν. G.

l. 24. prima die regi condempnabitur in c. solidis
argenti do quolibet comitatu. Cf. P. R. 7 Hen. ΙΙ Norlhum-
berland, 24 ‘Idem vicecomes reddit compotum de c. s pro mora
compoti sui. In thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus est? Ibid. Oxsord,
p. 273 forks, p. 37 ; Slafford p. 423 Somerset, p. 51; Essex, p. 67.
In this last case the Sheriff was fined ἐγ 1os.—-which would suggest
that he was a day and a half late. Similarly on the Pipe Roll of
1 Ric. Ι (Kent‚ p. 232) we find Alan de Valeines, Sheriff of Kent,
fined ἑὸ 5 for being thirteen days late (cf. Madox‚ H. E. xxiii. § 22,
p. 695). This seems to show that the rnore merciful course was
adopted in actual practice. For the later rule, see L. T. R. Memor-
anda Roll, 40 and 41 Henry III inter Recorda quoted by Madox‚
H. E. xxiii. ξ 2, p. 644, n.f It will be seen that for the first four
days the fine was then rated at τὲ 5 per day ; after that it was at the
King's discretion. Before the order of 40 Henry III (as also some

tenl years later) the fine was fixed at 225 for the first three days
on y.
