2 INTRODUCTION

contained in the treatise, with full discussions of many incidental
points, in which will be found some conjectural attempts to improve
portions of the text. Most, if not all of these, have been included
in later editions of the Select Charlers.

The Select Charlers text, the one most accessible, is still substan—
tially the text formed by Madox and Holmes. But this text is in
places uncritical and the collation untrustworthy. For an instance
of both these faults we may refer to ΙΙ. ἰί. Ε, F, where Madox
reads ‘diceres hunc illo longe mitiorem extitisse,' with the note
‘L. N exisse? The reading in both N and R is, however, ‘ mitius
exisse,' and the correct reading is without a doubt ‘mitius egisse!
Here the mistake does not affect the sense, but in the preface to
Part I, B the conversion of the ‘mammona’ of the MSS. into
‘in misericordia’ has made nonsense of the passage.

The first object which we proposed to ourselves was the con-
struction of a better text than the existing one. An examination
of the MSS.1 showed that only four of the many in existence were
likely to be of use for this purpose. Of these four the MS.
known as Hargrave 313 was found to be only an incorrect tran-
script of that in the Red Book, without any trace of an independent
source. The three remaining were the Red Book of the Exchequer‚
here called R3 the Black Book of the Exchequer, here called N;
and the Cotton MS. Cleopatra A 16, here called C. It speedily
became clear that none of these three was the original, and that
in all probability none was even copied from it. It was also clear
that R and N were copied from a common original, which was
not the original of C. Comparison of R and N showed further
that their common original omitted certain passages which existed
in the original of C ς moreover, the signs of uncertainty shown
in the MSS. as to the proper order of the words in many pas-
sages suggested that interlineations or marginal notes had
been differently interpreted by the two unknown originals. Con-
siderations of this kind led us to the conclusion that the history
of the MSS. before us was probably the following. From the
original text of Richard Fitz-Neal two copies, which we will call
X and Y, arose. X, while in a good condition, was copied into
the Red Book of the Exchequer in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and at a later date, at the end of the same century, when
