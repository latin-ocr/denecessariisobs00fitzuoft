Honor< DE BELVEEIR

‘ Willelmus de Luuetot reddit compotum de 50lz'. et 6s. et 8d. de
firma honoris de Belueeir. In thesauro 30lz'. et 6s. et 4d. Et in
procuratione liberorum Willelmi de Albeneio 18lz'. et 5s. Et
in custamento vinee 3 5s. et 4d. Et Quietus est.’

firma illius honoris. The use of the term Honor is very
difficult to fix. The author of the Dialogus appears to imply
that it is equivalent to Baronz’a and that it consists of several
manors ( fundi). On the other hand all tenants-in-chief are classed
as ‘Barones maiores' or ‘Barones minores' (ξ E. below). Pre-
sumably therefore Honor is regarded as equivalent to ‘Baronia
maior.’ The minimum requisite to constitute an Honor is not
stated (cf. Pollock and Maitland, i. p. 239). The argument of ξ Ε.
implies that the tenant of a single knight's fee would be a ‘Baro
minor' since the certainty of relies depends not on the extent of
the estate held, but on its being held of a mesne lord. Probably
the distinction must be drawn between baronies possessing an
honour court, and baronies not having such a jurisdiction. But
the terminology of the Dialogus renders it difficult to be sure
that the author had any clear notion of a barony or an honour in
his mind.

P. 134, l. 13. Liberationes vero seruientium. Charities once
established must be kept up by the ⁶ guardian ' 3 wages of servants
not required need not be paid by him 3 the heir must pay both his
father’s charities and the wages of the servants engaged by him,
but he need not use the services of the latter.

1. 30. In propriam. Probably an allusion to the death of
Chiron from the poisoned arrow of his pupil Hercules.

P. 135, 1. 7. Si vero decesserit, διο. The law for tenants-in-
chief differed from that for under-tenants. Compare Glanvill (ix.
4. ξ 2) ‘Mortuo vero patre vel antecessore alicuius, vt praedictum
est, et herede relicto qui infra etatem sit, nullum ius habet dominus
feodi in custodia heredis vel hereditatis, nisi prius recepto homagio
heredis. Recepto vero homagio in custodia ipsius domini re-
manebit heres ipse cum hereditate sua sub forma predicta, donec

plenam habuerit etatem. Tandem vero eodem ad etatem per-
ueniente‚ quietus erit a releuio ratione custodie . . . . (ibid. ξ 4).
Cum autem heres masculus et notus heres etatem habens relin-
quatur, in sua hereditate se tenebit vt supradictum est etiam inuito
