NOTES 181

ἑὸ 12s. 2d. as the ‘census statutus' of the honour of Belvoir
sor Michaelmas term, 14 Henry ΙΙΙ, and for 2350 6s. 8d. for the
firma of the year ending Michaelmas, 15 Henry ΙΙ, and the
firma remained the same until Michaelmas‚ 18 Henry ΙΙ. Census
is clearly applied in this passage to the rents due from tenants for
the term immediately following the taking of the honour into the
king's hand. The corn (from the demesne manors apparently),
‘ Bladum maneriorum preter semen,' is accounted for separately at
ΕΩ 10s. 7d. As this does not appear again, it must be included
in the firma. Census is also the technical term for the fixed
tribute paid by exempt monasteries to the Apostolic See. Again,
census is applied to the rent of some lands held in 21 Henry ΙΙ
by Alcher the huntsman and Richard his son (p. 79). The author's
account is clearly inadequate; and in view of the fact that the
census of many of the sorests‚ e. g. Nottingham, Cannock, the
Dene, the New Forest and Feckenham, and the wood of Orcop,
had remained unchanged from 31 Henry I to 21 Henry ΙΙ, it
seems more reasonable to suppose that a census is an assessed
or fixed rent as opposed to a firma which might or might not be
altered. But even this distinction cannot be pressed, since in one
instance (that of Westbury) the census in 21 Henry Π was half
that received in 31 Henry I.

these rents are said to be assessed (censerz).' The passage is
suspicions, and it is possible that ‘ per afferesim ' should corne before
‘ et sic.’

l. 9. pretitulatis tamen nominibus. Cf. e. g. P. R. 21
Hen. Π, Oaford (p. 13) ‘ Noua Placita et Noue Conventiones per
Randulfum de Glanuill et Hugonem de Creissi.‘ (NB. The Pipe

1. 19. linea . . . caneeuet. He is to cancel it by drawing
a line under it. The usual methods of altering ancient writings
are ε (1) Erasure (abradere), or scraping the words off the parchment
and either leaving the space blank, filling it up with a line, or
writing the new words over the erasure. (2) Cancellation proper, i. e.
drawing a line through the words to be cancelled (cf. I. vi. C, below),
or if the entry is a long one drawing cross lines through it. (3)
