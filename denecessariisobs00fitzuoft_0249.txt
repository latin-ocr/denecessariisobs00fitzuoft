Madox (IIz'sl. Exclz. ix. ξ 3. n. (o), p. 193) in which the Sheriffs
of London challenged two successive assays and demanded
a third. In this case (which is quoted from the Communia of
Trinity Term on the Memoranda Roll of 14 Hen. 111) the third
assay was not granted, but the sum paid in was provisionally
blanched at the rate of 70¹. in the fi, although the assays had given
rates of 14d. and 12d. respectively. The question of the third
assay was adjourned till further order.

P. 86,1. 28. ignis . . . infusione. These words are difficult
to translate and explain, and are possibly the result of a note
subsequently incorporated in the text. They are intended to make
clear the process described above in the words ‘importunis estua-
tionibus vexet illud atque consumat,' and the first part of the
passage, ‘ igniS scilicet ex estuatione‚' only repeats those words in
a slightly different form. The difficulty is in the words ‘plumbi
infusione? Probably they had not much more meaning for the
author than they have for us. He admits (infra, I. vi. K) that
he knew little about the process of assaying, and he may have
merely wished to indicate in a vague way that lead was used in it.
The ways in which silver might be lost in an assay cannot all be
included under the two heads here given. Professor H. Louis,
who has been good enough to consider this question for us,
suggests that the words ‘ plumbi infusione ' refer to the portion of
the process called by the Gerrnans ‘eintranken‚' i. e. the melting
of the silver in the bath of molten lead. The passage is alluded
to in one of the appendices to the treatise ‘De Moneta' in the
Red Book of the Exchequer (Red Book, p. 1006), and is there
paraphrased ‘ vel propter nimiam estuationem vel alzl‘er} showing
that the fourteenth-century assayer who wrote the note did not
understand ‘ plumbi infusione.'

l. 9. sub eodem nomine firme, ‘ on the same account, that

l. 31. Fuerunt autem, ete. In quoting this opinion our
author appears to imply that the money of Henry 11 was pure
silver. As a matter of fact it appears to have been of ‘the old
