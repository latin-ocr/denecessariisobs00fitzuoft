176 DE SCACCARIO

must satisfy half of each debt at Easter before the amount paid
in thesauro on account of farm can be actually credited to him.
His ‘memoranda' tally may therefore require alteration. The
sum shown on the memoranda tally in its final form must then be
‘blanched,' and the tally cutter then returns to the sheriff a tally of
full length (longiorem), which the sheriff produces again at Michael-
mas. See Introduction, pp. 41, 48 and 50.

P. 73, l. 31. non tamen . . . debito. The construction of this
clause is very loose. ‘ Vicecomites’ understood seems to be the
subject of ‘offerant'; ‘quod iam solutum fuerit ’ of ‘redigatur'
and ‘vicecomes’ understood of ‘absoluatur’ ; but ‘ oblata talea'
may be taken as a nominative. The sense is the same.

P. 74, l. 5. Immo quia. See Introduction, p. 41.

1. 10. Memoranda vero . . . meretur. Here again the con-
struction is confused. The sense seems to be as follows. When
the sheriff pays in money on account of his farm he is given
a Memoranda tally which is shorter than an ordinary tally.
When the money is blanched the Memoranda tally is destroyed,
and the payment is then first expressed by a lawful tally of the
ordinary length with a separate tally attached to it showing how
much has been deducted on account of blanching. Compare
however ‘ Introduction to the Study of the Pipe Rolls' [P. R. Soc.
vol. iii], p. 69, where another interpretation has been adopted.

l. 14. In summo: i. e. at the broad end of the tally which
is supposed to be nearest the cutter.

l. 26. ex patentiore parte, ‘on the obverse of the tally.'
The tally is bevelled off at the narrow end, and therefore the
obverse, consisting of one side and the bevelled end, is longer than
the reverse, which consists only of the other side.

l. 27. que . . . annotatione, ‘the edge which is uppermost
when the tally is inscribed! The tally cutter is holding the tally
with the square end towards him, the bevelled end from him and
sloping downwards and outwards. The plain edge of the tally is
underneath and the writing on the side of the tally is the right
way up.

1. 30. hoe est denarii, ‘that is to say, the pence.' These
words appear to be an early marginal note which has crept into
the text. They occur, however, in all manuscripts.

l. 32. Marcam autem auri. The mark of gold appears to
be distinguished from the pound of silver by the position of the cut
