INTRODUCTION 21

Henry 11 restored to william Mauduit, the younger brother of
Robert Mauduit, not only the office of Chamberlain, but also the
castle of Porchester, and all lands appendant to that office and
castle. This grant, so far as the castle of Porchester goes, never
took effect, but there is abundant evidence that the office of
Chamberlain returned to the Mauduit family in the person of
william Mauduit, who was succeeded by his son william, probably
in 11581. This william, the younger, is mentioned as sitting in
the Curia Regis² as Chamberlain at Michaelmas‚ 1165 ; and first
appears on the Pipe Rolls as Chamberlain in 1167. The Testa
de Nevill³ shows another William as still possessed of the office of
Chamberlain and the connected manor of Hartley Mauduit.

The story of the other chamberlainship is more obscure. It
has already been said that in 1130 Geoffrey de Clinton held the
other chamberlainship. We have not been able to connect this
office with any definite estate during his tenure of it, nor can
we trace any connexion between him and Warin F itz-Gerald, who
appears as Chamberlain with William Mauduit in 1156. But from
that point the descent of the office is clear, and is associated with
the tenure of the manor of Sevenhampton in Wiltshire ⁴. Warin
held the office until 1161, and was then succeeded by his brother
Henry, who was succeeded by his son Warin F itz-Henry in 1 174.
Both the Fitz-Geralds are mentioned on the earlier Pipe Rolls as
receiving money ‘in camera curie ' and we see that the Chamberlain
of the Household was still closely connected with the Chamberlain
of the Exchequer ⁵.

In the Exchequer of Receipt almost the whole staff is made
up of the deputies of the Treasurer and Chamberlains. The former
is represented by a clerk, and the two latter by knights, who
receive the usual wages⁶ of a knight, viz. 8d. a day. The clerk
secures the treasure chest with a seal, and each knight has a key;
so that all three are jointly responsible sor the custody of the
treasure. The clerk keeps his account in writing‚ and the knights ⁷
by tallies, just as in the upper Exchequer. These three officers
