50 INTRODUCTION

penalties for breaking the law, or so-called voluntary payments
made to the king with the object either of obtaining some con-
cession‚ or of escaping some punishment. The former may be
called amercernents, the latter fines. Reliefs, or the sums paid by
heirs to be allowed to have possession of their lands, cannot
conveniently be classed under either of these heads ¹. On all fines
a payment of 9 per cent. is made to the queen, whose clerk attends
in the Exchequer to receive it ². These amercements, fines, and
reliefs are collected upon the report of the Justices in Eyre‚ and the
account is subdivided into sections according to the eyres in which
the debts were assessed ³. The debts assessed by the central court
sitting at the Exchequer have a section to themselves 4, and the
most recent amercements and fines come under the heading
‘ Nova Placita.'

The next stage of the sheriff’s account is the account of the
goods of felons and fugitives and usurers, measure-trove, διο. This
is the last item on the roll ⁵. The sheriff is bound to collect and
account for such goods without being summoned to do so ⁶. The
reason given for the separation of these casual profits from the
escheats is not convincing⁷ ε it may be conjectured that they corne
last because they cannot be formally demanded, but depend on the
evidence of the sheriff. Probably this stage of the account was
dealt with by the Treasurer, but of this we cannot be certain.

The account of the sheriff's farm can now be completed ⁸. For
this purpose all the members of the court are called together: the
sum paid in by the sheriff (or what is left of it after the satisfaction
of the other accounts) is set out in counters on the table. The
sum to be deducted for blanching is calculated at the rate deter-
mined by the assay. The tally for the payment made at Easter⁹
is produced, with its combustion tally attached. The sum of the
two blanch payments is added up and recorded on one tally, to
which another smaller tally is attached showing the amount de-
ducted for blanching. The sheriff is only credited with the amount
expressed in the larger tally, but the Treasurer is accountable for
the sum of the two. The total with which the sheriff is credited
remains set out in a pattern of counters on the Exchequer table.
The Treasurer now produces the Roll of Farrns (Rotulus Exac-
