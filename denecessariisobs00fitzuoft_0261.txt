NOTES 197

Legis Edwardz‘ Confissoris cap. 1 1, which asserts that Danegeld was
raised to pay soldiers to keep off pirates, and was paid annually at
the rate of 12d. the hide, thus confusing Danegeld with ‘ Heregyld'
(cf. Liebermann‚ Ez'nl. p. 107). Neither author was aware that it
was abolished by Edward the Confessor and was not paid annually
in pre-Norman times. Cf. Leges Henrici, cap. 15, and Lieber-
mann [seber die Leges Edwardz' Corfissort’s, Halle, 1896, § 41. As
to the method of the assessment of Danegeld cf. Round, Feudal
England, p. 91.

P. 102, l. 3. Cum fortis . . . possidet. Luc. 11, 21. It is
not strictly true that there were no invasions of the ‘ Danes ' during
William's reign, but the typical piratical incursions had ceased for
some years before the conquest.

l. 6. noluit hoe vt annuum solui. The account of Dane-
geld here given is inconsistent with the entries observed by Madox
in the Pipe Roll of 31 Hen. Ι, where Danegeld appears as paid
annually (H. E. c. xvij. ξ 1, p. 475). Under Henry II it was
collected only in the second and eighth years of his reign. An
entry occurs in the Pipe Roll of 20 Henry II (p. 115) of the
amercement of Osbert de Brai ‘ quia prohibuit Danegeldum dari de
dominiis ἐ and in the next year Elias the usher received one mark
‘ ad portandum summonitiones de Danegeldo per Angliam ' (P. R.
21 Hen. ΙΙ, p. 15). But it is not clear that any Danegeld was
actually collected at these dates. In all probability the tax was
practically obsolete at the date of the Dialogus.

audieritis bella et opiniones bellorum.’

l. 16. dominia. The definition here given of demesne
differs from that in use in later times. It means all the land which
has not been granted out in see, and thus includes all land held by
servile tenants. At a later date land held by a manin dominio is the
land actually in his own hands, land held in servicio is the land held
of him by whatever tenure.

l. 25. essartis forestarum; barons of the Exchequer are
not liable for the annual payment due by way of fine from those
who have cleared and tilled land in the royal forest, provided that
such clearing was made before the death of Henry Ι. This is dis-
puted by some who point out that such payments arise from offences,
pardon for which must be by special writ. But, on the other hand,
the penalty is a fixed one, and is charged on the land not on the
