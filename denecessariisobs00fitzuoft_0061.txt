INTRODUCTION 33

and adduces the evidence of the country people on the royal
demesnes ‘who have learned from the fathers how much in the
pound they are to pay.' On the other hand it contains a passage¹
which makes two misleading assertions: (a) that blanch farm is not
mentioned in Domesday, (b) that blanch farm was invented by
Roger of Salisbury. This latter passage may we think be safely
rejected as a gloss on literary grounds alone. Its contradiction of
the rest of the Dialogus may be held to confirm that view.

In another passage ², while the assertion that money paid in
by the sheriff is blanched by assay remains, we find that the farm
of a fundus is blanched by the profits of the hundred court. This,
taken with the passage referred to above, seems to imply that (a)
the tenant paid an extra allowance for blanching at a fixed scale,
(b) that he recouped himself frorn the profits of the hundred court
when they were granted to him 3 otherwise the allowance was
found by the sheriff from the same source ³.

We may accordingly say that except for the passage already
rejected the account of blanch farm in the Dialogus is not
necessarily inconsistent with itself. Turning to the evidence not
contained in the Dialogus, we must first consider that of Domesday
Book.

Here the only evidence available as to payments is to be found
as a rule in the surveys of the Terra Regis. There are one or
two trifiing exceptions‚ e. g. amongst the lands of the Bishop of
Bayeux, in Count Eustace’s lands in Essex and Herts and also in
certain lands, apparently an escheat, in Norfolk and Suffolk. We
cannot therefore assume that such methods of payment as we find
there were, or were not, peculiar to the king's lands. It will also
be noticed that Norfflumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland‚ and
Durham do not appear in the Domesday return. In Shropshire
and Cheshire the king held no lands. In Sussex he had Bosham,
which is always accounted for separately, and Rotherfield, which
was land of the Bishop of Bayeux. The land he held between
Ribble and Mersey was an escheat, and his possessions in
Middlesex were insignificant. It will be observed that the counties
