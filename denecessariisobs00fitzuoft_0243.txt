NOTES 179

P. 78, 1. 25. calamus . . . scribentis. Ps. xliv. 2 ‘Lingua
mea calamus scribae velociter scribentis.'

l. 31. ministrat verba. The treasurer actually dictates to
the scribe the matter to be enrolled. Cf. Horace, Ep. I. xv. 20
‘ quod verba ministret.' ,

Ρ. 79, 1. 8. scaccarium illius: sc. rotuli. The reading ‘illius
diei ‘ has no manuscript authority and is repugnant to the sense of
the passage. Mistakes in the roll may be corrected during the
session of the Exchequer in which the roll is drawn up, but not
later, except by royal authority.

1. 12. superioribus. These are the ‘maiores' of the Ex·
chequer mentioned in other places; cf. ΙΙ. i. B, infra.

l. 15. rotulos. It should be observed that rotulus in this
passage is used to mean a single sheet consisting of two mem-
branes. This use is quite regular in the Exchequer at a later date,
and is as common as the use of rotulus for the bundle of sheets
fastened together at the heads which we call a Roll: e. g. P. R.
1 Ric. 1, Surum, p. 217 ‘Idem vicecomes debet {19 125.
numero de terra Willelmi Malueisin in Gumesselua. Set reddit
inde compotum in Rotulo honorum.' (The ‘ Rotulus honorum ' is
the first sheet of the Pipe Roll of 1 Ric. Ι.)

On the system on which the roll is drawn up see Introduction,
pp. 48 seqq.

l. 21. prenotantur. This refers to the heading at the
left-hand top-corner of the roll, which is (at this date at all events)
peculiar to the Pipe Rolls, and serves to distinguish them from
the Chancellor's Rolls, even when the schedule of combustions has
been lost. The purpose of it was no doubt to facilitate the use
of the separate rolls of which the Pipe Roll is composed 3 as each
accountant appeared the Roll or ‘ Pipe’ on which his account was
could be readily picked up out of the heap. Any one who has
turned over a Pipe Roll will appreciate the necessity of this arrange·
ment. The rolls were clearly written up beforehand and the
numbers and ‘Quietuses’ filled in as occasion arose. It is quite
possible that the rolls were not filed until the next year, if then
(cf. Red Book, ΙΙΙ. 858-860, on the filing of the Pipe Roll in Α. D.
1323). The system of writing out blanks remained in use until
the abolition of the Exchequer, and some blanks are still in existence.
That the filing of the Pipe Roll does not represent the order in
which the accounts were taken is clear both from the variations
