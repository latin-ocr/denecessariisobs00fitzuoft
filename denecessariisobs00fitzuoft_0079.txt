paid in. The outgoings are next written out according to the roll
of the previous year ; and if any change has occurred, the Treasurer
varies his dietation accordingly. The sheriff now produces vouchers
for paymen'ts out made by him by virtue of the king's writs, which
he produces ¹. The writs are compared with their duplicates, in
the hands of the Chancellor's clerk if they issued from the
Exchequer ², in the hands of the Constable's clerk, if they issued
from the Curia Regis ³. These vouchers are handed to the Marshal‚
who preserves them ⁴. The sheriff then states what he has spent
on the wages of approvers and in the administration of justice (i. e.
on ordeals and executions); for these payments he produces no
vouchers ⁵. The account of the farm is now left open until the
other debts are discharged, because, if any of them has not been
duly levied‚ the deficit must be deducted from the sum paid in on
account of farm.

The sheriff next accounts for any balance of the last year’s farm,
or of that of any previous year, still owing, whether by him or any
of his predecessors.

Here a short space is left in the roll ⁶, and the account of the
farms of escheats and purprestures follows 3 that is, of lands which
have escheated to the king by failure of heirs, and of encroachments
on the king’s property. These are charged according to the
report of the Justices in Eyre‚ on the presentment of the juries of
the hundreds.

After this corne the rents of woods and forests ⁷.

These subsidiary accounts are balanced at once ; the sheriff
accounting either in writs, as before, or in tallies showing the sums
paid in by him or by others on these accounts. Such tallies are
compared when produced with the stocks from which they were
cut, which are in the hands of the tally cutter ⁸.

When the account sor the rent of woods and forests has been
closed, the examination of the sheriff by the Treasurer is suspended.
The Chancellor’s clerk takes up the summons ⁹ and formally
charges the sheriff with the debts which he has been ordered to
levy within his county. These arise from two sourceS‚ being either
