204 DE SCACCARIO

view of the passage, viz„ that the receipt of the third penny depends
not upon the possession of an earldom, but upon a special grant.
The ‘Reporls on the Dignz'ly of the Peer’ iii. p. 68 in the main
support our view that the words ‘ ratione . . . decernit' are
exegetical of ‘comites sibi creat‚' and explain the nature of the
partnership. The negative evidence of the Pipe Rous is adduced
by Mr. Round in support of the view taken by him3 and it is of
course likely enough that the author of the Dialogus is simply
blundering in his assertion. We would, however, urge on the
other side, that Mr. J. H. Round himself admits that there is
evidence in the case of Leicestershire and Oxfordshire of the pay-
ment of the third penny in cases where the Pipe Roll is silent.
Of this a specific instance may be given from the 40th year of
Henry ΠΙ. Madox (c. xxiii. ξ 2. p. 651. n. l.) quotes the writ
directed to the barons of the exchequer ordering thern to cause
John de Warenna (who had just come of age) to have the third
penny of the county of Surrey, as William de Warenna his father
and his other ancestors had had it as appurtenant to his earldom
(comitatus) of Surrey. There is no mention in the Pipe Rolls of 40
or 41 Henry ΙΙΙ of any payment of the third penny in consequence
of this writ3 but it would be difficult to argue from this silence that
it was not made. Surrey is one of the earldoms for which the
Pipe Rolls of Henry II are also silent, and the silence is equally
inconclusive there. The conclusion seems to be that we do not
know how the third penny of the county was paid, except in
the cases mentioned on the Pipe Rolls. But cf. Selden, Titles
ofHonour p. 528, for a quotation from Close Roll 2 Henry 111.
m. 9, showing how the matter was dealt with in Lincolnshire.

So far we have only discussed the English evidence. But
payments of this kind were in use all over the continent. The
principa] passages will be found collected in Ducange's Glossarium
s.vv. Aduocatus, Fredum, Comes de lertio denario. Only the more
important are mentioned here. It may, however, be pointed out
that the third penny of judicial fines was very generally regarded
as the proper share of the judge presiding over the trial ς and it
will be remembered that the continental ‘comes’ is to a large
extent a judge. In the capitula of Charlemagne (Perta. Legg.
I. p. 46) we find the principle expressly stated. De compositionibus
