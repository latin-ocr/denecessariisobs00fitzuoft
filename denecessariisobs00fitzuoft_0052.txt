26 INTRODUCTION

Bohun family, though it cannot be assumed that at first it was held
by inheritance.

The office of marshal 1 during the reign of Henry II was held by
John the Marshal‚ whose name frequently occurs on the Pipe Rolls‚
and whose presence at the Exchequer is referred to by Fitz-Stephen.
In 3 Henry 11 he is found making certain payments to falconers ²,
as described in the Dialogus.

The remaining officers of the Exchequer cannot be assigned to
any department of the king's Household, and may perhaps be re-
garded as specially appointed to act in the Exchequer as such. It
is particularly remarked that the office of ‘ calculator ³ ' ‘ nulli
illic residenti convenit ex officio nisi cui Rex vel Iustitia mandaverit
exsequendum‚' though we know that it fell ultimately into the hands
of the marshal of the Exchequer ⁴.

Two offices appear to have been created by Henry ΙΙ in addition
to the old staff of the Exchequer‚ and in neither case does the
Dialogus give us any hint as to the titles borne by their occupants.
The first of these two, Richard of Ilchester‚ Bishop of Winchester,
is described as sitting ‘ex officio quidem sed ex novella constitu-
tione ⁵.' His duties⁶ seem to consist in assisting the Treasurer in all
his work, especially in the writing of the roll. The office seems not
to have continued ⁷, and perhaps never received any special name.

The other office which was also created ‘ ex novella constitu-
tione ⁸ ' seems also to have been a temporary one. The holder of
it was Master Thomas Brown, the king’s almoner⁹. His duties
were to watch and record all proceedings in the two Exchequers
on the king’s behalf. He had a staff of two clerks, one sitting
behind the writer of the Pipe Roll and keeping a roll, which was
the special property of his master, and the other in the Receipt
keeping a controlment roll of issues and receipts in the lower
Exchequer.

The roll kept by him and his clerk in the upper Exchequer
presents some difficulties. The language of the first passage in

⁷ It is not clear whether the Bishop of Winchester is an assistant to the
Treasurer or a check upon him. We incline to the former view, notwithstand-
ing the words ‘ indempnitati providetur’ (Dialogus, I. v. Q); but it must be
noted that the author was himself Treasurer.
