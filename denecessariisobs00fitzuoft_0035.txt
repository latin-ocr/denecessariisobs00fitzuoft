INTRODUCTION ' 17

Chancellor's place in sealing all Exchequer writs‚ he probably
became in fact independent of the Chancellor, and received the
title of Chancellor of the Exchequer. The date of this change is
not known, but can be approxImately arrived at from the following
considerations. It is certainly later than 14 Henry 111, on the
Close Roll ¹ of which year is a writ dated Nov. 8, in these words:
‘Rex mittit baronibus de Scaccario Robertum de Sancto Medardo,
clericum, ad scribendum ad scaccarium regis, loco Nicholai de
Nevill, nomine R. Cicestrensis episeopi.' It is clear from this that
Ralph de Nevill, Bishop of Chichester‚ the Chancellor, was at this
date Chancellor also in the Exchequer. On the other hand, in
32 Henry III ², Ralph of Leicester resigned the office of Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Forthcoming publications will probably settle
the matter past a doubt. In the meantime it may be suggested
that 22 Henry ΠΙ, when the king took the seal into his own
keeping, is a likely date for the change to have taken place.

The Chancellor’s scribe was the immediate subordinate of the
‘clericus qui preest scriptorio ³! His duties were to copy the
Pipe Roll, while it was being written by the Treasurer’s scribe,
and to write all the writs issued out of the Exchequer by the
Barons, including the summonses for the ensuing term. His pay
was 5d. a day⁴ during the session of the Exchequer, apparently
the customary wages of a scribe ⁵. It may be noted that he is
the only member of the Chancellor’s staff whose pay is given
in the Dialogus. In process of tirne he became the officer known
as the ‘ Comptroller of the Pipe.'

Passing over the departments of the Steward and Butler, which
are not represented at the Exchequer, we come to the Chamber-
lain's department. In the ‘Constitutio’ there are two officers
mentioned under this head, each receiving 55. a day. These are
the ‘Magister Camerarius ’ and the Treasurer. The Chamberlain is
a constant member of the Household, while the Treasurer only
receives his allowance ‘ si in Curia fuerit et servierit in thesauro?
This seems to point to the separation between the Treasury and
the ‘ Camera Curie’ which we find at the date of the Dialogus ⁶. Os
