and all persons connected with hawks and hounds who come to
the Exchequer for their wages. The duty of attesting writs for
payments out of the Treasury here nominally falls to the constable,
but it is clear that he seldom, if ever, executed that duty ¹.

The constable's clerk also performed his duties by deputy ².
He cannot be identified clearly with any offieer named in the
‘Constitutio Domus Regis’3 in the Exchequer his special func-
tion is to attend with the duplicates of the writs issued in the
Curia.

The marshal in the Exchequer has the custody of the vouchers
presented by all accountants3 he keeps the prison of the Exchequer,
administers oaths‚ and delivers the writs of summons to the usher
to be served. Originally the marshal of England performed these
duties in person ³, but afterwards they fell into the hands of a clerk,
like the clerk of the constable ; and both these clerks continued to
officiate until the fourteenth century ⁴.

The succession of the office of constable is obscure ⁵. Ulti-
mately it became hereditary in the family of the Bohuns, afterwards
Earls of Hereford and Essex ς but the process by which they
acquired it is not clear. The first constable under Henry II was
Β the well-known Henry de Essex, who forfeited the office in 1163,
when vanquished in the judicial contest at Reading. The next
holder of the office was Humphrey de Bohun, who seems to have
obtained it soon after coming of age in 1174 ⁶. It is possible that
his appointment was due to his relationship to Miles of Gloucester,
who had been one of Stephen's constables, and on quarrelling with
Stephen became the constable of the Empress Maud. At the same
time, Humphrey cannot have inherited the office of constable, or
even the ⁴ honor constabularie‚’ from Miles, since neither Roger nor
Walter of Hereford, the sons of Miles, appear as constables in the
reign of Henry Π ⁷. As has been said, the office continued in the
