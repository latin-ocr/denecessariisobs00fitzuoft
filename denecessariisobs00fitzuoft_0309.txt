a previous holder, or on a change being made in the coinage which
involved his obtaining new dies from the King. The former case
is called ‘ releuamentum ’ in Domesday (i. 179, a Hereford) where
both cases are mentioned. The latter seems to be meant in the
following passage of Benedici os Peterborough, a0 1180 (i. p. 263
Rolls Series) ‘Eodem anno . . . Henricus rex Angliae fecit in
Anglia nouam monetam fieri, . . . et rex monetarios suos redemit,
id est, ad redemptionem coegit.’ On this occasion, however, as will
be seen from the Pipe Rolls the King endeavoured to Supersede the
local moneyers by a central mint, whose officers are distinctively
spoken of as ‘ cambitores Regis?

l. 25. Numquid in (penis) pecuniariis. It seems neces-
sary to supply (penis), see II. xii. A above.

l. 31. sue dignitatis . . . priuilegium. It was at least con-
tended that ecclesiastical sees were as such free from common
amercements: see Madox, Η. Ε. xiv. ξ 3, p. 375, where a plea is
quoted from the L. T. R. Memoranda Roll of 35 Hen. ΙΙΙ (rot. 3 a)
‘cum feodum ecclesiasticum participare non debeat de communi
fine comitatus, ut dicit? Compare however II. xii. B, C above.
Many instances of exemption will be found on the Pipe Rolls, but
in most cases the houses exempted had charters of exemption.
With regard to ordinary debts, when a clerical debtor had no lay
see by which he might be distrained, distress could only be made
upon his ecclesiastical benefice through his bishop (see Madox,
H. E. xxiii. ξ 23, p. 703).

P. 158, l. 21. ipso . . . procurante. The keeper of an escheat
is not allowed to exact ‘ procurations' as bishops and archdeacons
do on their visitations. ‘Procurations’ were originally the sood
necessary for the entertainment of the visitor and his following.
For ‘ exeniorum' cf. Walter Map, De Nugz's Curialium, p. 224
‘ Scriptos habebat omnes comites et barones terre sue, constituitque
eis in aduentu vel mora curie sue certa exennia, quibus eos
honorabat, in candelis, pane, vinoque.'

l. 2 5. non alligabis . . . trituranti. 1 C or. ix. 9 3 1 Tim.
v. 18.
1. 30. por verum dietum suum. Cf. P. R. 17 Hen. ΙΙ, p.
117 ‘ Randulfus de Glanuilla de exitu Honoris Comitis Conani
per verum dictum Reineri seruientis sui. In thesauro 62 [τ’. et 45.
et 5d. Set non reddidit compotum.'
