52 INTRODUCTION

So far as the facts stated in this passage are concerned, they are
supported by the Pipe Rolls. Up to the eighth year of Richard Ι
there is no entry of the total farm of the county on the rolls‚ while
from that year each county account is headed by the amount of the
farm. But it is difficult to believe that there was any intention to
conceal from the sheriffs the sum with which they were charged;
each sheriff‚ as he sat at the Exchequer, would surely have dis-
covered that amount, and would have had no reason to conceal it
from his successor, who would have had every reason for ascertain-
ing it. But, setting this aside, it may be noted that as soon as the
farms began to be entered on the Pipe Roll, the Exactory Roll
became superfluous. The Pipe Roll of the preceding year plays
an important part in the process of accounting for the current
year, and it was an additional convenience to enable it to replace
the Exactory Roll. When that roll became useless it was sure to
disappear, as the Roll of Danegeld had already done with the dis-
appearance of Danegeld.

Besides the normal business of passing accounts there were other
matters of importance to be determined in the Exchequer1. Such
were points of law or of policy arising in the course of the process
of taking accounts. On such occasions the Barons retired to the
Exchequer Chamber to avoid interfering with the ordinary course
of business ². It seems certain that the Justices also habitually sat
at the Exchequer, and that the Court of Common Pleas originated
in the Exchequer‚ and not in the Curia Regis ⁸. This would ex-
plain the Subsequent position of the Exchequer Chamber as a court
of appeal⁴. The question need not, however, be discussed here,
since the Dialogus is only incidentally concerned with legal affairs.
The practice of making fines of land in the Exchequer is also easy
to explain, since the essence of the transaction is the bargain made
with the king for leave to terminate a suit.

We have now described in outline the functions of the Exchequer
Court as such, but the Dialogus reminds us that another account

took place at the Exchequer table which cannot be regarded as
an ordinary session of the court ⁵. As the sheriff accounted to the

Treasurer, so the Treasurer and Chamberlains accounted‚ though
seldom, to the king ⁶. Certain payments were made out of the
