NOTES 215

eius residens esse debet cuius ligius est.' Here of course ‘ ligius ’ is
applied to the tenant. Cf. also ibid. c. 55, ξ 2. And as to the
essoin ibid. c. 59, where ‘ domini necessitas ' is mentioned as one
of the reasons sor postponing a suit. See Pollock and Maitland‚
H. E. L„ i. 269.

P. 125, l. 1. Sunt et. Neither Glanvill nor the Leges Henrz'ci
primi attempt a complete list of essoins. In all probability ex-
ceptional cases were considered on their merits. As the essoin
became a mere incident of procedure, the essoin of sickness
appears to have superseded all the rest.

l. 7. miles. This word seems to be used in the sense of an
under-tenant as distinguished from Baro, a tenant-in-chief. The
doubt of the discipulus is whether an under-tenant can be with-
drawn from the service of his liege lord to serve the King.

l. 16. ‘an . . . manus?’ Ovid, Heroides 17, 166.

l. 20. siout predictum est. Cf. I. iv. C above.

l. 22. noueris. The Sheriff pays money into the treasury
first and accounts afterwards ; the assay (examen) is part of the
process of paying in. Cf. I. ii. above.

l. 27. Prouideat autem. The object of this intimation to
the debtors is not clear 3 it is impossible to suppose that everyone
who owed money to the King was present at the Exchequer to see
that the Sheriff paid it in properly; but it may be suggested that
the intention was to afford any interested person an opportunity of
checking the Sheriff’s conduct, if he wished. If this is right,
‘ omnibus' below must mean all persons present and concerned in
the account, not all the debtors.

l. 32. sicut dietum est. Ι. i. B above.

P. 126, l. 5. ne forte; the tag is repeated from Ι. vi. C above.

1. 6. scriptoris thesaurarii: see I. v. R above.

l. 15. Quis insuper. See Ι. vii. above.

l. 18. Cum ergo rex, The King might grant a manor with
or without the jurisdiction attached. Cf. Leges Henrici primi, c.
19 ‘Omnium terrarum quas rex in dominio suo habet socnam
pariter habet, quarundam vero terrarum maneria dedit sed socnam
sibi retinuit singularem et communem nec sequitur socna regis data
maneria set magis ex personis? In the former case the manor was
said to be granted ‘blanch,’ and the allowance was made to the
Sheriff in blanch silver. For instances see Pipe Roll 1156 (2

Hen. 11) p. 57, and 21 Hen. II (1175), p. 21, where a man has
