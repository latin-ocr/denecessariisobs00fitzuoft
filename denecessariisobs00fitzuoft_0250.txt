186 DE SCACCARIO

standard of England‚’ and therefore would loose 180⁷. in the 2¹5 on
assay even if of full fineness. See Introduction, pp. 30 seq.

P. 87, 1. 33. que numerata. The reading of the MSS. seem
to be untranslatable‚ and quam is no better. Cui makes sense, but
is a violent alteration. The reading que seems the easiest way out of
the difficulty. Translate, ‘ if the pound when tested falls away more
than 6d. from the proper weight‚ while in tale it is of full number!

P. 88, 1. 2. superscriptio . . . auctorem. The name of the
moneyer formed part of the inscription of English coins until the
reign of Edward Ι.

1. 4. districte conuenietur‚ ‘shall be strictly summoned'
or ‘called to account.’ Cf. P. R. 1 Ric. I, London, p. 227
‘Henricus Anglus reddit compotum de 76s. et 8d. quia retinuit
flatones (dies) operis monete in sua custodia postquam remotus
suit a monetagio et quia cambiuit contra assisam (he coz'ned un-
lawsul money). In thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus est.'

1. 7. denarii seems to be a gloss. All MSS. have redigetur and
eius. The nominative to be supplied is probably pecunia or opus.

l. 9. Verum . . . erit. This passage, from the uncertainty
of its position in the text, is obviously a marginal note subsequently
interpolated. ‘ Generaliter peccatur ab omnibus' may allude to
the delinquencies of Philip Aymar and his companions, who were
royal officials, in 1180.

l. 17. excedentes legem communem, ‘having more
than the usual alloy.' The point is that new money is expected
to come up to the standard, while in the case of old money an
allowance of 6d. is made for wear before the money is condemned.

l. 20. liberatio naucleri: the word ‘ nauclerus‘ is a classi-
cism. The holders of the office can be gathered from the charter‚
Campbell Chariten, xxix. 9 (B. M), by which king Henry ΙΙ
(circa 1 155) grants to William and Nicholas, sons of Roger, son-in-
law of Albert‚ and the heirs of Boniface, Azo, Robert and Ralph
their brothers, ‘ ministerium meum de esnecca mea,' with the salary
pertaining theret0‚ and all the land and fees which Roger held in
chief of king Henry I. The word ‘esnecca' is of Scandinavian
origin, meaning snake or fast ship used for war.

l. 30. Non satis noui, etc. During the progress of the
assay the bright surface of the molten silver is hidden by the
melted litharge which floats on it, forming the black cloud
spoken of 3 towards the end of the ‘cupellation’ this cloud
