INTRODUCTION 3

the edges of its leaves had suffered a good deal from wear, it was
again copied into the Black Book (N). The recurrent lacunae in
the Black Book point to a MS. of small sizel or else in double
column. Other indications² suggest that the lines of the MS.
were short. There was a considerable number of omissions in
the text of X, and the scribe seems to have been in places unin—
telligent. Of Y, the original of C, less can be said. There are
few omissions of importance, and the most striking characteristic
is the frequent inversion of words by which the order of the text
differs from that in N and R. We have here assumed that X and
Y derive directly from the original text, but of this there is of
course no proof‚ while the agreement of C, N, and R in the insertion
of certain passages, suspiciously like interpolations‚ might suggest
the interposition of other MSS. between the original and X and Y.

We may now proceed to describe the MSS. we have used.

R=The Red Book of the Exchequer (King’s Remembrancer‚
Miscellaneous Books‚ No. 2), ff. 31—46.

A MS. on parchment, υἷ’ >< Ssss', in double columns, rubricated,
with the initials illuminated alternately in red and blue. The ⁴ Red
Book' has always been preserved in the Exchequer as a book
of authority, and contains various collections relating to matters
concerning the Exchequer administration. A fuller account of it
m'll be found in Mr. Hubert Hall's edition in the Rolls Series,
pp. i-cxlviii. The handwriting is dated by Mr. Hall in the second
quarter of the thirteenth century 3.

H=British Museum‚ MS. Hargrave 313, ff. 2—5 and 16-29.

It has a considerable likeness to R, of which it is apparently
a contemporary copy. We collated this MS. as far as I. v. H,
but as it showed no trace of representing any independent authority
we have not recorded its various readings ⁴.

N = The Black Book of the Exchequer (Treasury of Receipt),
ff. 18-45.

A MS. on parchment, 1o{'' χ 6;1[”, in single column, written for the

² There were apparently 250 words more or less to the page or column,
about half as many as in a page of the Hargrave MS. It might reasonably be
a double column MS. of about the same size.

² Certain omissions seem to fix the length of the lines, e.g. Pref. B, R omits
‘in stipendiis ministrandis ’ς Ι. iii. D, R omits ‘id quod expresse nominatur!
Ι. v. C. Here R omits the final word ‘ scriptoribus ’ of D’s question aud M's
