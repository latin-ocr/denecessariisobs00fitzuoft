INTRODUCTION 51

torius), and the farm is set out above the sum paid in. The latter
sum is now subtracted from the farm, and from the remainder is
now subtracted the sum of all allowances expressly made in blanch
money. The new remainder is left on the table, and all the allow-
ances or payments out made by tale are added up and reduced to
their value in blanch money by a deduction of one shilling in the
pound. This sum is now subtracted from the remainder of the
farm, and if nothing is left the sheriff is discharged; otherwise he
remains in debt for the balance. The roll is now filled up, the
sum expressed in the larger tally being set down as paid ‘in
Thesauro ¹ at the head of the account, and the balance, if any, being
entered below with the words ‘Et debet! If there is no balance the
account concludes with the words ‘ Et quietus est ’3 if a balance is
due to the sheriff, with ‘Et habet de superplusagio '—so much.

The sheriff must now give his oath to the marshal¹ that in those

cases where he has been unable to levy debts due to the king he has
found nothing to distrain upon ². He is then free to go.
, The greater part of the debts collected by the Exchequer are
levied through the sheriff ‚· but there are already other accountants‚
since certain towns and estates account separately ³. These account-
ants have to make oath to the accuracy of their accounts in the same
way as the sheriff ⁴.

As to the nature of the Exactory Roll and its companion, the
Roll of Danegeld, in the Red Book of the Exehequer⁵ there is
a eurious note on the use of these two rolls in the process of
accounting, which may here be translated :--‘ There is no sum
of Danegeld set out upon the roll, just as there was no sum of the
county in any roll of Henry II or of King Richard up to the eighth
year of his reign ; and that for this reason, as I heard from William
of Ely, the Treasurer, namely, that the sheriffs might be kept in
ignorance of the sum for which they had to account. But, after
the writing of the sheriffs account and adding up the sums ex-
pended from the body of the county‚ the Treasurer brought out
the roll containing the sums of the several counties and placed the
particular sum above, and then subtracted the expenses, and so
aequitted the sheriff or placed him in debt or allowed him a surplus.
This also was done sor Danegeld; but that roll I never saw, though
the other Ι have seen.'
