duas vero ad Palatium3 et si per suam negligentiam reman-
serint et missus dominicus ipsas causas coeperit requirere, tunc
volumus vt ipsi comites illam tertiam partem non habeant sed cum
integritate ad Palatium veniat. This rule apparently applies both
to the Frankish and Lombard portions of the empire. But that it
was still more widely spread can be shown from the description of
Hungary in the Gesta F rederz‘cz‘ Imperatoris by Otho of Freisingen
(Muratori vi. p. 665, cf. Selden, T. ΜΗ. p. 388), who says ‘ Hinc
est vt cum [Vngaria] per lxx. vel amplius diuisa fit comitatus, de
omni iustitia ad fiscum regium duae lucri partes cedant, tertia
tantum comiti remaneat? It would appear, therefore, that the third
penny of the pleas is the final remnant of the judicial functions of
the earl, and is originally due to the Frankish empire. Whether
this imperial institution reached the England of Henry II through
William the Conqueror, or whether it came with earlier importations
from the same source, admits as yet of no exact determination.

unhappily perished. We may assume that it resembled the later
‘Rotulus de Corporibus Comitatuum,' now preserved among the
Pipe Rolls. The amount of the sheriff’s farm was presumably re-
corded on the roll. It first appears on the Pipe Rolls in 9 Richard Ι
(see G. J. Turner, The Sherzff's Farm—in Trans. (gf the Rcfflal
Hz'storz'cal Socz‘ety, vol. xii. p. 121). See also T he Red Book (ff
