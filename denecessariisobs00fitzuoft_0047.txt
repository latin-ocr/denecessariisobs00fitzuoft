INTRODUCTION 23

melter; but it appears that William the Melter, who died about
4 Richard I, had lands ¹. There is a Richard Fundor named in
the Pipe Roll of 3 Henry 11 ², and a Gilbert Fusor occurs in
26 Henry 11⁸, but he may have been employed in the recoinage
of 1180, and not in the Exchequer. In 24 Henry 111, Otes, son
of John the Melter, sold the serjeanty to Edward, son of Otes the
Goldsmith, apparently a member of the well-known family of
Fitz-Otho‚ which held the office of cutter of the dies. And in
13 Edward I the king purchased the office from Otes of West·
minster, possibly the representative of that Edward ⁴.

The usher of the Exchequer and the usher of the Receipt may
most conveniently be discussed as one officer. The Dialogus is
not indeed explicit upon this point ,· but there is reason to think⁵
that the usher of the Receipt serves in the name of the usher of the
Exchequer. The passage⁶ in which the treatise states him to be
the servant of the Treasurer and Chamberlains is not inconsistent
with this view. But it can be shown from other sources that the
ushers of the Receipt and of the Exchequer were only another
instance of a duplicated office. Roger of Wallingford‚ who is
mentioned as ‘ostiarius Thesauri⁷’ in 2 Henry ΙΙ, received the
‘ Magistratus Hostierie de Scaccario' by a charter⁸‚ which is dated by
Mr. Eyton as about Michaelmas in that year. Assuming‚ therefore,
tha we are only dealing with one office in two different placeS,
it may be pointed out that we have here an old office belonging
to the original staff of the Treasury and Chamber. Like the
offiees of the Chamberlaffls, the weigher, and the melter‚ it was
a serjeanty; and was connected with the manor of Aston Rowant ⁹
(Estone) in Oxfordshire‚ which is mentioned in Domesday among
the ‘Terre Ricardi et aliorum ministrorum regis: Both in the
‘ Constitutio ¹⁰ ’ and in the Dialogus ¹¹ there is an apparent connexion
between the offices of the usher and the marshal. But closer
inspection makes it probable that the usher is primarily an officer
of the Treasury, and not, like the marshal, an officer of the Curia.
