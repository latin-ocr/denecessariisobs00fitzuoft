NOTES 225

usurarii disponatur! The Dialogus contradicts Glanvill as to the
disposition of the usurer's real property, but the ‘ vix ’ shows that the
contradiction is not absolute. Cf. Liebermann (Einlez‘tung, p. 100),
who holds that Glanvill is right. The making of the will is probably
considered not as a condition apart from that of repentance‚ but
only as evidence of repentance‚ so that the apparent discrepancy
between Glanvill and the Dialogus must not be pressed. Cf. how-
ever below ΙΙ. x. Ι ‘vita comite poenituerit et testamento con-
dito: διε. But intestacy seems to have been regarded as the natural
punishment of the sin of usury. Cf. Pollock and Maitland‚ ii. 354,
for the case of Hamo B1und, ‘ who died intestate and is commonly
accused of having lent his money upon usury? Chron. jocelini de
Brakelond (Camden Soc.) p. 67. Note that making a will is closely
connected with death and the sacrament of penance. For accounts
of the goods of usurers seized see Madox, H. E. x. ξ 8, p. 237.

P. 136, l. 21. vel ciuis etiam. Madox’s conjecture ciuis is ren-
dered certain by the repetition of the phrase in the question of the
scholar immediately following. Clericus is a tempting conjecture
in both cases,· but probably the sentence is intended to exhaust all
the lay class; and ‘vel ciuis etiam ' only points to the fact that
usury in a citizen might be thought a venial offence.

P. 137, l. 21. priuilegium demeretur. Cf. Gratian's Decretum
II. c. 14. qu. 4 for a similar statement.

l. 24. prudentibus: i. e. jurisprudents. The following passage
might almost be a reminiscence of Glanvill loc. cit.

l. 29. ecclesia non reclamante: even if the church has
a claim, she will make none to the goods of an usurer 5 it is
doubtful if the church had any claim at this> date to the goods even
of intestate clerks. But note that the rule is growing up that the
goods of an intestate are to be dealt with by the bishop; cf. on
the whole subject Pollock and Maitland, ii. 3⁴54.

P. 138, 1. 2. more Iudeorum. A Jew might take usury of
a Christian without breaking any law of the Church or of the Land.
A curious case is quoted by Madox from P. R. 4 Ric. 1. rot. 9 a
(H. E. vii. §6, p. 166, note u) ¹ Iudas Iudeus de Bristo debet ii uncias
auri pro inquisitione facienda in Capitulo Iudeorum si Iudeus debet
capere usuram a ludeo! ‘In eadem specie‚’ i. e. the interest must
be of the same nature as the principal; it is not public usury to lend
money and receive goods in discharge of the debt, whatever the
value may be.
