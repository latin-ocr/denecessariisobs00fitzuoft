NOTES 199

unpopular inquiry: cf. P. R. 17 Hen. ΙΙ (1171) p. 30, Laneus-ter,
‘De placitis Alani de Neuilla.'—‘ Totus comitatus de Lancastra
debet 200 marcas vt visus foreste poneretur in respectum vsque ad
aliam reguardam foreste! At such an inquiry all essarts made in the
interval would be examined and arrented, i. e. the holders of them
charged with rents and fined. In all charters of disafforestment
the regard is specially mentioned as abolished.

P. 104, 1. 5. apposito numero . . . exurgebat: cf. ΙΙ. c. ix.
below where the reason of this precaution is explained.

l. 7. stupebant . . . dicentes: cf. Matt. xii. 23 ‘Et stupe-
bant omnes turbae et dicebant: Numquid hic est filius Dauid?'

l. 14. por locum a maiori. By the commonplace‚ or
argument ‘ a fortiori? ‘Locus’ translates τόπος; the term ‘locus
a maiori’ appears to be borrowed from the Classification of the
Topics by Themistius (cf. Boethius, De Dg‘fferentiz's Topicis, ed.
Migne, 2. c. 1204 C.).

l. 27. mandorum. This word is very difficult to explain,
There is no trace of corruption in the manuscripts, and Madox's
conjecture of aliquorum appears untenable. Liebermann (E inl. p. 8)
suggests ballz'uorum which seems little better. The late bishop of
Oxford‚ retaining the reading of the text, suggests that the
word may be ‘alanorum ’ from ‘ Alanus ' a hunting dog. We are
inclined to suspect that the reference is to Alan de Nevill, Chief
Justice of the forests under Henry ΙΙ, who appears repeatedly on
the Pipe Rolls and who held pleas in 9 Hen. II and 12 Hen. II.
There was also an Alan de Nevill junior connected with the
forest administration. If the reading is to be altered ‘ Alanorum ’
might be suggested referring to the two Alans ; but it seems better
to retain ‘ Alaniorum ’ ancl explain it as a derivative from ‘ Alanus:
meaning ‘ minions of Alan de N evill.'

l. 34. mihi restituta est summa. Nigel‚ bishop of E1y,
retired from public life in consequence of an accident in 1 164 and
died in May 1169. If the transaction here recorded took place
during this period it is presumably that recorded on the Pipe Roll
of 13 Hen. II p. 167 (Mich. 1167), in the account sor Cambridge
and Huntingdon,-—‘ Idem vicecomes reddit compotum de 4os. de
Sumeresham et de Bluntesham Episcopi de Eli. In perdonis per
breue Regis ipsi Episcopo 4os. Et Quietus est.’ The entry occurs
amongst the ‘ Noua Placita et Noue Conuentiones per Alanum de
Neuilla,’ and one of the other entries under the same head refers
