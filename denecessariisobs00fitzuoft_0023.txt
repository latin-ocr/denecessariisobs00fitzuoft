Ealon Hall MS.

These are all modern transcripts.

We are indebted to ΜΓ. Hubert Hall for giving us a list of these
manuscripts, to which we have only been able to add two, and for
the description of those which we have not ourselves examined.

There is one MS. translation—

Brz‘lz'sh flluseum, MS. Lansdowne 610, entitled ίΣΚΑΚΚΑΡΙΟ-
ΛΟΓΙΑ.’ This is a translation of the Dialogus by ‘W. B. gent.’
Αο 1647, and has been made from N 0r some derivative of N.
It begins ‘It is necessary allwaies to be subject‚’ &c.

With these materials we have adopted the following method of
constructing our text. In orthography we have been guided by
the Pipe Rolls of Henry Π. These records were written under
the eye of the Treasurer and in his language ¹, and may fairly be
taken as representing his standard. As a result we have expelled
j from the alphabet‚ and made use of v at the beginning and u in
the middle of words to represent either u or v. In such words
as ‘ exitium ' we have preferred t to c, and we have used the single
e instead of the diphthong ae. We have attached no importance
to the spelling of any of the MSS. Where the reading is doubtful
we have considered the evidence of N and R combined as slightly
superior to that of C alone; but in the absence of agreement
between N and R we have almost invariably followed C, and have
considered the agreement of C m‘th either N or R conclusive
evidence.

We have been unable to regard certain passages as forming
part of the original argument of the treatise: our exclusion is
based for the most part on historical or logical incompatibility
between the parts excluded and the rest of the treatise. Once
a passage in itself suspicions is variously placed in two of our three
MSS.; but as a rule the MSS. agree in the insertion of the pas-
sages we regard as interpolations. We are not, however, bound
to assume that the archetype of X and C was a copy from the
original MS. with its marginal notes inserted at the points at
which they occurred. We may assume the original MS. to have
been completed before April, 1179 ; the date of R is approximately
1230-1246. We have at most to place two intermediate MSS.
within fifty-two years, and allow time for the second to become

¹ 1. v. R. ‘Ministrat verba.’
