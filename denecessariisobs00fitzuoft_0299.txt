NOTES 231

quotes a case from the Memoranda of 39 Hen. 111 (Rot. 9. a.)
which illustrates this point. The King on tallaging his demesnes
attempted to get a lump sum of 3,000 marks from the citizens of
London, and they offered 2‚000 by way of aid. The King being
dissatisfied attempted to assess the tallage per capita. The case
ultimately turned on the difference between a tallage and an aid,
a distinction which does not appear in the Dialogus. Again (ibid,
p. 509, note d) he quotes from the Memoranda 40 Hen. ΙΙΙ rot.
18 b, ‘ Ostensum est ex parte Hominum de Bedford, quod curn
Homines eiusdem ville talliati sint per capita, Vicecomes iniuste
distringit communitatem predicte ville, ad reddendum tallagium
quod assessum est super certas personas: et ideo mandatum est
Vicecomiti quod de demanda etc. predicte communitati pacem etc.;
et distringat illos qui talliati sunt per capita.’ The common liability
of a town is always the result of its own act, not of that of the
government.

P. 146, l. 4. miles aliquis vel h'ber alius. Dr. Liebermann
(Ueber Pseudo-Cnut De Foresta, p. 28) compares this passage
with the division of classes in the so-called Forest Laws of Cnut.
He remarks ‘ The classification of rank os Pseudo-Cnut agrees
with that of the time of Henry ΙΙ.. . . The several classes of
dependent people, from agricultural tenants down to slaves, are not
distinguished. As by Richard Fitz Nigel and Walter Map, the
Vz'llanus is classed with the Servus, from whom he is still clearly
distinguished by Domesday in 1086. Pseudo—Cnut does not count
the Middle Class (sc. mediocres or lessthegnas), as Liberales Just as
Richard does not count the rich Burgesses and tradem, who were
doubtless free, as Liberi?

l. 14. hiis similis. Cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. i. 65-6 ‘rem facias,
rem, Si possis, recte 3 si non, quocumque modo rem.'

1. 32. ex promisso. The regular ‘exchequer phrase for an
undertaking, by which the person making it became a ‘ debitor.’

l. 35. catana que licite venduntur. This appears to be
the earliest authority on the law of distress. Cf. Bracton, ΙΙΙ. 444 sq.
for a more elaborate account. In both accounts the ‘ ordo ob-
servandus ’ is dealt with, and so far as the order of things goes,
the two authorities agree. ‚As to the order of persons, there is a
remarkable discrepancy. The Dialogus places the order as follows ;
first the debtor's own property, second the property of his villeins,
and third the property of the under-tenants of the debtor and their
