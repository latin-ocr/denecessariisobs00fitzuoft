NOTES

PAGE 55, line 1. ordinatis a. deo. In this preface the author
is endeavouring to justify the double position of statesman and
ecclesiastic which had marked three generations of his family. His
political philosophy is that of a strong adherent of the king as
against the conception of a separate secular and ecclesiastical
state, and he makes use of almost the same language and the same
citations as Hugh of Fleury in his treatise De regia poteslate
(c. 1100). All power is from G0d; therefore in serving kings,
the ecclesiastic serves God; kingly power is dependent on dignity,
and on wealth; there may be bad kings, but the judgement of
their wickedness is for God; their subjects must obey them,
and look after their wealth without regarding the use to which it
is put. The four cardinal virtues are necessary, but need money
to succeed. And therefore the author will write on financial
administration,fflis”ffie ‘m‘c'sst'important part of government.
With the views thus stated contrast John of Salisbury’s satirical
comments (Polycratz'cus, c. xvii. 677 A, Migne) on the practice of
obtaining clerical preferment by civil employment. ‘ Voluit esse
nobilis inter laicos aut certe magnus in clero. Ob hoc principum
virorum quaesivit gratiam, familian'tatem iniit, ab eis quascunque
suscepit functiones. Scriniis forte praelatus est, aut consignandi
suscepit officium aut cimelii custodiam, aut publici claves aerarii,
aut ratiocinii varias cautiones, aut si quid aliud nequit, ut corbibus
praeficeretur, obtinuit? Cf. Rom. xiii. 1 ‘ Omnis anima potestatibus
sublimioribus subdita sit: non est enim potestas nisi a Deo : quae
autem sunt a Deo ordinatae sunt.’ John of Salisbury (Polycratia-us,
Migne, c. 455 A) quotes the text ‘ omnis potestas a domino Deo
est‚’ as ‘ illud Salomonis,' referring to the Vulgate (Sap. vi. 4) ‘ Data
est a domino potestas vobis.'

The form of the preface is of course borrowed from Justinian's
Institutes (‘Imperatoriam maiestatem non solum armis decoratam,
sed etiam legibus oportet esse armatam,’ ὅτε.) as is also that of ⁴
‘ Glanvill.'
