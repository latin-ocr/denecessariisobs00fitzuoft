under any pretext from a land-owner gave him a right to make
a similar levy on his under-tenants. But if the chief lord were
free from any particular exaction, he was not allowed the use of this

must get a special writ to enable him to do so.

P. 96, 1. 34. virum itaque, ‘and so to a man of much skill

P. 97, 1. 9. bellica tempestate: i. e. the civil wars of the
reign of Stephen. It is possible that there were no sessions of the
Exchequer during the period of confusion in Stephen’s reign3 at
any rate the Pipe Roll of 2 Henry 11 shows that the finance of
the kingdom was only emerging from confusion at that date. See
transactions of the R. Hist. Soc. vol. xii. p. 1175 The Sherzff ’s
Farm, by G. J. Turner.
