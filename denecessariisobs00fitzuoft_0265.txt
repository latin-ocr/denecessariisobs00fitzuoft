NOTES 201

P. 106, l. 20. Figuraliter, ‘in outline? Boethius translates ὡς
τύπῳ λαβεῖν (Arist. Top. 1. 7, 1) by ‘ vt figuraliter sit sumere ¹ (Top.
Arist. Interpret. i. 6. ed. Migne. 2. c. 914. C).

l. 21. terminum . . . constitui. Cf. Ps. ciii. 9 ‘Ter-
minum posuisti quem non transgredientur.'

l. 22. Prom' enim . . . promouendam. Cf. Rom. xi. 13
‘ Ministerium meum honorificabo.'

l. 32. si bene meminit compare Ι. ν. D. above for the
allusion to the seal. There is a mention of Domesday Book in Ι.
iv. A. on which see note.

P. 107, l. 3. Vbi. . . tuum: Matt. vi. 21.

l. 5. auri thesis. This derivation is Isidore's‚ Elym. xvi. 18.

l. 23. supra: cf. Ι. ν. Ι); for the chancellor’s deputy or vicar,
cf. Ι. ν. Ε, Ι. vi. D. above.

l. 25. deambulatorio. The seal of the ‘curia' followed
the king. The seal of the Exchequer followed the sessions of the
Exchequer. But, in some cases, in the absence of the King abroad
the seal of the Exchequer was used for sealing chancery writs ; cf.
Patent Roll 14 Henry III part 2. m. 2 ‘Hie incipit sigillum de
Scaccario currere post transfretacionem Regis!

l. 30. Henrico quondam . . . episcopo. Henry of Blois
(c. noo—1 171), brother of King Stephen and bishop of Winchester
(1129-1171). It seems possible that Richard the treasurer cites
him as the source of his information by way of implying that it
was not derived from Roget of Salisbury. Henry’s age and his
residence at Winchester would give a special value to his statement.

l. 35. decreuit, &Q The chapter must be regarded as
a piece of conjectural history. It pieces together the tradition of
the Witan of 1070 preserved in the introduction of the Leges
Edwardz· Confessortlr, the fact of the diversity of English laws
mentioned in the Lez‘s Willelme and the fact of the existence of
Domesday Book, into a connected story. Of these constituents the
first rests only on vague tradition and is most probably the in·
vention of a writer about 1135 (Liebermann, Ueber die Leges E.
Cf ξ 34), and neither the first nor the second has any known
relation to the third. Again, the object of Domesday Book was
ἶ undoubtedly the assessment of Danegeld (cf. Maitland‚ Domesdqy
Book and quond, p. 3), and the assertion that it was intended to
define the rights of individuals most probably rests on its later use
to decide whether a given manor was or was not ‘Ancient
