INTRODUCTION 15

Of the great Officers of the household‚ two (the Steward and the
Butler) have no seats at the Exchequer. But the Chancellor, the
Treasurer and Chamberlain ¹, the Constable‚ and the Marshal all
appear either in person or by deputy. And these, with other persons
who sat there by the king’s order ², were known as the Barons of
the Exchequer.

The survival of this term in the Exchequer until recent years
has earned for it an attention which it hardly deserves. In the
Dialogus itself the word ‘ Baro ’ is normally³ applied to the mem-
bers of the Court of Exchequer. In one passage, however (ΙΙ. xix),
it is used of all tenants-in-chief‚ and we may fairly assume that that
is the primary sense of the word in English records. Any court of
the king is normally composed of tenants-in-chief‚ and consequently
any member of such a court is normally a baron. Thus the king’s
justices were sometimes known as barons ⁴. The members of the
House of Lords and the burgesses of the Cinque Ports are still
called barons ; and the occurrence of the term in the Exchequer is
in like manner a survival from the early organization of that court.

The next step in the argument is the comparison of the organiza-
tion of the king's household under Henry I ⁵ with the account given
of the Exchequer under Henry ΙΙ.

In the former we find six Officers each receiving an allowance
of five shillings a day. These are the Chancellor, the Dapiferi
or Stewards‚ the Butler, the Chamberlain, the Treasurer, and the
Constables.

The Chancellor appears in the ‘ Constitutio' as the head of
a department, which includes the Keeper of the Seal (or llsogz'sler
Scrzjn‘orz'z) and the king's chaplain. In the Exchequer his staff
consists of the ‘ cleircus qui preest scriptorio,' a clerk, and a scribe.
Both in the Curia and in the Exchequer he is responsible for the
sealing of all writs issued under the Great Seal, of which for this
purpose a duplicate ⁸ is kept in the Treasury by the Treasurer and
Chamberlains in a bag sealed with the Chancellor’s own seal. In
the Exchequer he is, as the keeper of the Chancellor's Roll, equally
responsible with the Treasurer and Chamberlains for all the pro-
ceedings of the upper Exchequer. There is reason to think that

¹ These two officers are here considered together. Cf. ‘Consu Dom. Reg.‘
