INTRODUCTION 45

so far as the information of the Dialogus goes, the Treasury‚ like the
Receipt and the upper Exchequer, passed into a ‘ vacant interlunar
cave?

It is useless to endeavour to extract from the Dialogus, which is
a treatise on the action of the Exchequer while sitting, information
as to what took place when the Exchequer was not sitting; and
for information as to the site of the permanent repository of the
treasure and rolls of the Exchequer we must turn to other sourceS.
The question is briefly this: when the Exchequer ceased to sit,
what was done with the money and documents that were in the
hands of the officers?

At a later date the question can be answered. They were placed
in the treasuries at Westminster ¹; but in the reign of Henry II
no such easy solution can be offered. Broadly speaking, Win-
chester, the capital of Wessex, the original home of the Norman
Treasury, remained the place of permanent custody for both money
and rolls ². But, so far as the money is concerned, there is un-
doubtedly evidence of the existence of other treasuries in which it
might be placed, and it is quite possible that after the Exchequer
had sat at Oxford, sor instance, both money and rolls might remain
there for some time, pending their removal to Winchester or to the
next place at which the Exchequer might sit. Temporary treasuries ³
might, therefore, exist in many places; and the fact that the Ex-
chequer seems to have sat more often at London than at any other
place, excluding Winchester, would prepare the way for the final
removal of the permanent treasury from Winchester to West-
minster. The date of that removal is uncertain. It may be
conjecturally placed as happening about the end of the reign of
Henry II, and as becoming complete during the reign of
Richard I.

² lt is impossible to deal at length with this question here. Cf. ibid. pp.

Henry 11. pp. 11 and 16. The available evidence consists chiefly of notes
in the Pipe Rolls of the expense os moving treasure, &c.

³ We may instance the case ot* N orthampton. In 13 Henry 11 (Pipe Roll,
p. 103) the hutch of the treasure is moved from Northampton to London.
In 27 Henry II (Eyton, p. 241) there are a number of instanees in which
treasure is moved from N orthampton to other places. Compare also the case
