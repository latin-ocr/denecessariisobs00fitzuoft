P. 60, l. 14. scaccarium tabula quadrangula est: i. e. a rect-
angular board. There are entries on the Pipe Rolls of payments
for Exchequer boards‚ e. g. P. R. 10, Hen. ΙΙ, London, p. 21
‘ Et pro uno scaccario ante Barones 13s. 4d.' P. R. 12 Hen. ΙΙ,
Worc. p. 81 ‘Et pro 1 scaccario apud Wirecestriam ad faciendum
receptam Regis gs. et 10d.' cf. also Madox, H. E. xx. ξ 3.

1. 18. superiori. We have bracketed this word as suspi-

this passage, and secondly because an unintelligent scribe might

p. 197, where Robert de Hastings pays 2⁴35 6s. Sd. ‘ut placitum
. . . differatur usque ad scaccarium.'
