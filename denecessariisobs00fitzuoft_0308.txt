238 DE SCACCARIO

P. 156, l. 29. regine similiter tenentur: cf. Red Book, ii.
p. 760, where in the account of the coronation of Eleanor, wife of
Henry III, there is the following note3 Gilbert de Sanford claims
to be the Queen’s chamberlain; ‘he also claimed to have a clerk
in the Exchequer to exact the Queen's gold, who shall take of the
said gold each day 6d. for his wages; but the decision on this
claim is put off. And since mention is here made of the Queen’s
gold, note that men have held different opinions on this matter,
some saying that it was only payable, when anyone made fine for
his relies, others that it was from every fine of 100 marks and
upwards; others from every fine of 10 marks and upwards. And
although Richard the bishop states this (reading ‘recitet’) in his book,
yet it is clear that Queen's gold is due from every fine of 10 marks
and upwards, for whatever cause the fine is made; this may be
proved by the roll of 10 John in Berkshire, when the abbot of
Reading made fine for 60 marks . . . . and in the same roll he
renders account of 6 marks for the Queen's gold? With the
inclusion of reliefs among the fines from which Queen's gold was
due, compare the action of the Parliament of Oxford (Selecl
Charias, p. 882); ‘when the heir has made to the lord King a
reasonable relief on attaining his majority, the lady Queen thereos
demands her gold according to the reckoning of the tenth part,
and it seems that she ought not to have it save from a fine.’ It
does not appear that Queen's gold was paid upon reliefs after this
protest.

P. 157, l. 4. ab eius officialibus: Madox (H. E. x. ξ 10,
p. 240, note b) quotes from the L. T. R. Memoranda Roll 1 Edw. I
rot. 3 b. a note of such an appointment ς ‘ Memorandum quod xxii
die Ianuarii, W. Eboracensis Archiepiscopus Attornatus Domini
Regis Edwardi venit coram Batonibus, et presentauit ad Scaecarium
Walterum de Aubeny ad colligendum Aurum Alienore Consortis
predicti Regis Edwardi.'

l. 20. adhuc sub iudice lis est: Hor. Α, P. 78.

1. 21. de misericordia . . . Iudeorum. The tallage of the
Jews is no doubt meant. See Madox, H. E. vii. ξ 1, p. 150,
where several examples will be found of the arbitrary raising of
moneyfrom the Jewish communities.

1. 22. de redemptione monetariorum. The ‘redemptio’
appears to be the payment made by a ‘moneyer,’ or worker in a
county mint, either on his obtaining the office by the death of
