NOTES 223

domino, dum tamen domino suo sicut tenetur suum offerat homa-
gium coram probis hominibus, et suum rationabile releuium
alicuius iuxta consuetudinem regni, de feodo vnius militis centum
solidos; de socagio vero quantum valet census illius socagii per
vnum annum 3 de Baroniis vero nihil certum statutum est, quia iuxta
voluntatem et misericordiam domini Regis solent Baronie capitales
de releuiis suis domino Regi satisfacere. Idem est de serianteriis.'

The tenant who held of the crown accordingly paid no certain
rehef, and might even not be quit of his relief ‘ ratione custodie ’;
the tenant who held of the king as of an honour or escheat was in
the same position as any other under-tenant. Cf. Magna Carta,
cap. 43. Compare however Pollock and Maitland, i. 289. The
same inequality of rights will be noticed in the case of aid: since the
statute which determined ‘ rationabile auxilium ’ (3 Edward I. c. 26)
was clearly not held to affect the rights of the Crown (see
Inqut'sz'lz'ons and Assessmenls relalz'ng to Feudal Aids, Ι. p. xxiv).

P. 135, l. 10. sieut est episcopatus vacante sede. Cf. P. R.
14 Hen. ΙΙ. Be’shoprz'c qs Lz'ncoln, p. 78 ‘Hugo de Chaucumba
reddit compotum de 30lz‘. pro releuio 6 militum. In thesauro 1ol1'.
Et debet 20lz'. Helyas de Mundeuilla reddit compotum de 30 marcis
pro releuio 4 militum. In thesauro πο marce. Et debet 20 marcas.’

1. 11. c. solidos. It will be observed that the reliefs quoted
by Madox, H. E. x. §4 pp. 216 sqq„ work out as a rule at >25 per
knight's see, when the number of knight's fees is stated. An instance
from P. R. 10 Ric. I. (p. 217, note k), seems to show that §100
was regarded as reasonable relief for a barony (Willelmus de Novo
Mercato reddit compotum de 100 marcis vt rex capiat rationabile
releuium suum, scilicet 1oolz'.)‚ though the fine paid shows that
much more must have been commonly exacted; but by Magna
Carta (John), c. 2 {0100 was fixed as the relief of an earldom or
a barony, and the Pipe Rolls of Henry ΙΙΙ show that this rate con-
tinued to be employed.

1. 22. releuium repetere non valebis. Cf. ,Magna
Carta, c. 3 ‘ Si autem heres alicuius talium fuerit infra etatem et
fuerit in custodia, cum ad etatem peruenerit, habeat hereditatem
suam sine releuio et sine fine! This passage shows that Magna
Carta made what was law in the case of under-tenants also law in
the case of tenants·in—chief. Cf. Glanvill, ix. 4. ξ 2.

l. ²3· pro pupillis: cf. Isa. i. 17 ‘iudicate pupillo, defendite
viduam.'
