in Group IV. The counties not making payments in‘ Group IV or
Group V are Hampshire, Berkshire‚ Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Wor·
cestershire, Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire,
Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Yorkshire. (The
counties in which there is no information have been omitted.)

The total number of cases in which payments in Groups lv
and V are named is not large, and the instances are very unevenly
distributed. The largest number occurs in Norfolk‚ which has
forty ; Somerset has fifteen, Devon and Cambridge ten each 3
Hereford eight, Derby five (but these are ‘ puri argenti,' and come
from manors in Wirksworth Hundred, a mining district), Bucks
five 3 the Isle of Wight‚ Cornwall, Gloucester‚ and Suffolk four
each ; Bedford three, Essex three (all on Count Eustace's lands)‚
Lincoln two, Herts two (one of these, Tring, on Count Eustace's
lands)‚ Kent two (Canterbury and Milton); Sussex, Surrey, and
Dorset one each (viz. Bosham, Godalming, and Portland).

The counties making payments in Group II are Kent‚ Surrey,
Hants‚ the Isle of W ight‚ Somerset, Devon, Oxford, Gloucester‚
Hereford, Northampton‚ Leicester, and Stafford. Those making
payments in Group III are Kent, Surrey, Hants‚ the Isle of Wight‚
Wilts‚ Devon, Cornwall, Herts‚ Oxford, Worcester, Hereford, Bed-
sord, Northampton‚ Warwick, between Ribble and Mersey, York,
Lincoln, Essex‚ and Norfolk.

The conclusions to be drawn from this summary are somewhat
doubtful 3 some facts, however, seem to stand out clearly :—-

1. The usual method of paying money at the date of Domes-
day was by tale. Exceptional modes of payment are only noted
on royal manors ¹. It may be added that no facts are known to us
to suggest that payments blanch were ever made to private owners
at a later date, and we are strongly of opinion that such payments
were always confined to royal manors,

2. Payment by tale in coins of full weight and payment by
weight were not very common, and payment in assayed coin would
seem to have been very rare.

3. There are traces of the commutation of payments in kind into

¹ There are a few exceptions, noted above. Comparison of the Exeter
Domesday with the Exchequer Domesday entitles us to affirm that the
absence or presence of any note as to the form os payment is the result
of its absence or presence in the original inquisitions; and that the lack 01'
informatlign as to rents on private property suggests that no questions were
put on t t point.
