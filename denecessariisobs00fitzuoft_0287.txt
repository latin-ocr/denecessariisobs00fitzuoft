P. 133, l. 8. Porro eschaete djcuntur. The Dialogus
divides escheats under the following heads :

1. Escheats. Lands and goods of tenants in chief dying with-
out heirs.

2. (a) Lands and goods of fugitives frorn justice.

(b) Goods of those who sailed in the ordeal under the Assize

of Clarendon.

3. Treasure Trove.

4. Goods of Usurers.

Glanvill (VH. c. 17) dealing os escheats in general gives-—

1. Lands and goods of persons dying without heirs.

2. Of female wards guilty of unchastity.

3. Of selons and outlaws. The land going to the lord, the
goods and ‘ a year, day and waste of the lands to the king!

The goods of usurers are treated ofin the previous chapter.

Glanvill’s classification is more in accordance with actual prac-
tice than that of the Dialogus. Escheats are lands falling to the
king by reason of sailure of heirs or by the fault of the tenant. Of
course the author of the Dialogus writes from the point of view of
finance and this accounts for his classification, though the omission
of all reference to ‘marriage’ is curious. The expression ‘escaeta
(tum herede' appears to be peculiar to the Dialogus, cuslodz'cz
is· the usual term.

l. 22. cetera vero . . . cedunt. A case of ordinary law as
to wardships, cf. Glanvill, vii. 9.§ 3. Glanvill adds that ifa ward-
ship is granted by the king with the addition that if the grantee is
not to account at the Exchequen the grantee rnay present to
churches and otherwise trcat the estate as his own, in other cases
not (Ibid. 10. ξ 3). Such grants under various conditions will be
found in Madox (H. E. x. ξ 4, pp. 221 sqq).

l. 25. legittime etatis adeptus beneficia, i.e. in the case
of a military tenant on the completion of the twenty-first year, in
that of a sokeman on the completion of the fifteenth, and in the
case of a hurgess when the boy can count money, measure eloth
and so forth, Glanvill, vii. 9. ξ 2.

l. 29. Ille vel ille. Cs. P. R. 20 Hen. ΙΙ. p. 30 ‘Hun-
fridus de Bohun debet cc. libras pro releuio terre sue.' So
also P. R. 22 Hen. II. Rot. 5 b ‘Ricardus Malebisse reddit com-
potum de roos. pro releuio suo. In thesauro liberauit. Et Quietus
est’; and other cases quoted by Madox (H. E. x. ξ 4, pp. 2 16 sqq).
