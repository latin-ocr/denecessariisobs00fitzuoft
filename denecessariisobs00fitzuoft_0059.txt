INTRODUCTION 31

(i. e. silver with 18 dwts. of alloy to the lb.) had subsisted from
Saxon times ¹. Consequently had blanch payments been estimated
in pure silver the sheriff would never have had less than eighteen
pence in the pound to pay for the loss on the assay.

The Dialogus shows that 12d. was considered a safe allowance
for the difference between payments blanch and payment by tale
when the money, being a payment out by the sheriff, could not be
submitted to assay ². We learn also from the Pipe Rolls that as
little as a penny in the pound might be deducted in such cases ³.
In 19 Henry II the recorded combustions at Michaelmas varied
from 4d. for Northamptonshire to 190⁷. for Devonshire and the
same for the town of Southampton ⁴.

We cannot therefore suppose that the payments blanch were
reduced to their value in pure sssver, and are consequently driven
to conclude that the author's ignorance of the process of the assay
led him to omit all mention of the presence of the 18 dwts. of alloy
in each pound of standard silver.

Payment in blanch money was not the only form of payment at
the Exchequer. In the time of the Dialogus payments were also
made in tale, and at an earlier date two other systems known as ad
scalam and ad pensum had been employed. The most connected
statement made by the Dialogus on the whole subject is in the form
of a history ⁵ of the farm of the county and its method of payment.
No precise dates are given in this account, which starts with
a system of purveyance alleged to date from the reigns of William Ι
and William ΙΙ. Under this system the sheriff was answerable for
the farms of the king's demesne manors in the county. But these
sarms, though estimated in money, were paid in kind⁶ directly to
the Officers of the king's Household, and credited to the sheriff at

¹ The figures given by Sir william Roberts-Austen in 1884 (Journal os the
Society of Am, vol. XXXII. p. 842) from analyses of coins are as follows:
Ethelred II, 918·1; Canute, 93¹? Edward the Confessor, 943·2 and 940·4;
william Ι, 922-8. Besides these Sir William kindly examined coins of Henry I
and Henry 11 (before 1180) for uS. These were of fineness 9147 and 9²33
respectively. Here the worst coin has 20=5 dwts. alloy to the pound and the
best, 13=37 dwts. The approximation to the old standard is thus quite
sufficiently near.

still estimated in kind.
