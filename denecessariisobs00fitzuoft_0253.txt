Nonas 189

merely been describing the Exchequer‚ and thus has been able for
the most part to write semi—classical Latin. He now comes to the
privileges of those who sit there and apologizes for the barbarous
law terms he is forced to use. He feels that if he went on using
⁶ conficta nomina ' such as ‘miles gregarius: his work would
become quite unintelligible.
P. 93, l. 6. exquisito verborum scemati, ‘a nice derange-

ment of epitaphS.' R. B. Sheridan, T he Rivals.

l. 12. emula mens vel lingua: cs. Horat. Epist. Ι. xix. 15
‘ Timagenis aemula lingua?

l. 13. qui in seriptis . . . mittat: cf. Ioan. viii. 7 ‘ Qui sine
peccato est vestrum, primus in illam lapidem mittat?

l. 16. Digmtas residentium. On the exemptions enj0yed
by Exchequer officials in virtue of their office, cf. Mad0x‚ H. E. xx.
ξ 7. p. 554, where numerous illustrations are given. Dr. Lieber·
mann (Ez'nl. p. 63. n. 9) adds to the list of privileges the right of
having writs issued gratis 3 quoting Walter Map (D. N. C. p. 231)
‘Mos curiae nostrae fuit, ut gratis fierent et redderentur breuia
sigillata ministris euriae quae nomina sua vel negotia continerent.'

l. 20. non euocantur. In a case reported in Bracton’s
Note Book (Easter and Trinity Terms, 3 Henry ΙΙΙ), where an assize
of Mort d’ancestor was taken on behalf of Thomas de Wilne against
Master Robert de Neville, the following note is made ‘ et sciendum
quod hec assisa ponitur apud westmonasterium pro libertate
baronum de scaccario qui non debent alibi placitare.' Maitland,
Bracton's Note Book, Case 25. The privilege may be regarded
as analogous to the Essoin ‘per seruitium domini Regis’; see
Glanvill‚ i. cc. 8 and 27 ; but Glanvill in his treatment of the
subject does not refer to the Exchequer.

P. 94, l. 2. iter . . . arripere: translate ‘even though the one day

be so near to the other, that he be compelled to start on his Journey!

procuratorem vel responsalem, ‘ a proctor or an attorney.'
‘ Procurator ’ is an agent in an ecclesiastical, ‘ responsalis ’ in a civil
court. The latter word, which Glanvill employs (lib. xi), subse-
quently gave place to ‘ attornatus! ‘ Attornare ² and ‘ Atturnatio ’ are
however found on the Pipe Rolls (P. R. 12 Hen. II, p. 18; P. R.
14 Hen. ΙΙ, p. 222), so that it is probable that both Glanvill and
Richard Fitz-Nigel are making a concession to ‘ classical Latin.'

1. 6. nomine consuetudinis nichil soluunt. The word
consuetudo covers all kinds of customary payments, such as
