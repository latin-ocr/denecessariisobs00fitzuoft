NOTES 193

is clear that if enough sub-tenants had not been enfeoffed, the
chief lord would have to hire soldiers to perform his service; and
in the case of ecclesiastical fiefs there was always a doubt whether
their holders were bound to serve the king except in defence of
the realm. These two difficulties seem to have formed the point
of departure for a system, whereby the lord, instead of performing
his service, paid to the king a commutation for it. In the case of
ecclesiastical fiefs this procedure can be traced as early as the
year 1 1093 in the case of lay fiefs the evidence does not carry us
earlier than the year 1 159. See Feudal England by J. H. Round,
pp. 262 sqq., 532, 5333 Scutage and anglzt Service in England.

P. 99, l. 5. Ab hae . . . residentes. In view of the doubt cast
by Madox on this statement in his note we quote from the Pipe
Roll of 18 Hen. II the names of the following exchequer officers
exempted ‘per breue Regis' in that year: John the Marshal
(p. 15), Ranulf Glanvill (p. 31), Henry Fitz Gerald (p. 44), Richard
de Luci (p. 140). Most of these names recur.

1. 7. Murdrum. The history and administration of the
‘murder-fine’ are obscure. The Exchequer theory at the date
of the Dialogus was that for every homicide done secretly, so
that the perpetrator was undiscovered, the hundred was liable to
a fine of fi 36 or 2344 to the king3 that this was introduced by
William the Conqueror to put a stop to the frequent ‘murders’ of
Normans after the conquest; that originally only ‘murders' of
Normans were so punished, but that the gradual fusion of the
two races had made this distinction almost impossible except in
the case of men of unfree status. In several points this account is
incredible‚ but it is difficult to construet a tenable theory in its
place. If we turn to earlier authorities on the subject, such as the
Leges Edwardi Corfissorz's, 15, 16, Leges Willelmz', Ι. 22, 111. 3,
and the Leges Henrz'cz' XIII. 2, LXXV. 7, XCI and XCII, we find
details not mentioned in the Dialogus to as the liability of the town—
ship, or the lord, whose man the murdered person was, or in some
cases the chattels of the house where his body was found, the
hundred sometimes being only liable to make up the deficiency;
there are also statements as to the rights of the kinsmen, and
a general agreement that the amount of the fine was forty-six marks
of silver. If from these doubtful and differing authorities we
turn to the Pipe Rolls we find, firstly‚ that the fine is always levied
