INTRODUCTION 29

needed, or more. In either case a pound by tale (i. e. 240 pence)
was placed in a cup to be assayed‚ while the remaining twenty-four
shillings were returned to the purse. The melter received his see
of 2d.‚ and two sheriffs were appointed to accompany the sheriff
whose money was under examination and act as witnesses. The
pesour and the three sheriffs then went to the surnace, where the
melter awaited them. The coins were recounted‚ first by the
pesour and then by the mester, who proceeded to assay thern. As
the description of the process is confusing, a sull translation is here
given:

‘ The melter takes the coins in his own hand, counts them and
arranges them in a cupel, or test of wood ashes (vasculum zgm'torum
cinerum), which is in the furnace. He then reduces them to an
ingot (massam) according to the rules of the melter's art, melting
and purifying the silver. But he must be caresul not to stop before
the process is complete, nor to vex and consume the silver by
unnecessary heat3 since, in the former case the king, in the latter
the sheriff, would lose. He must take every care and exercise all
diligence that the silver be not consumed, but only thoroughly
refined by heat (ad purum excoquatur) 3 those who are sent by the
Court must give heed to this same point. Now, when the test-
piece is made, the pesour takes it to the barons, accompanied by
the others, and weighs it before all their eyes against the pound
weight mentioned above: he proceeds to supply what the fire has
consumed by adding pieces out of the purse until the test-piece
balances the pound weight. Then the test-piece is marked with
chalk with these words, “Yorkshire. The pound burnt so many or
so many pence‚'' and then it is called an ‘⁴ assay‚'' for it is not marked
until it has been admitted that it should be so marked. But if the
sheriff whose assay it is challenges it on the ground that an undue
quantity has been consumed [sc. by overheating or by the melting
of the silver into the lead], or if the melter admits that for some
reason the test has failed, twenty shillings are once more to be
counted out from the remainder in the purse, so that the test may
be repeated as before.’ Again¹z ‘ As long as a certain black cloud
is seen floating about on the surface of the molten silver the test is
considered incomplete. But when certain minute grains, as it were,
are brought up from the bottom to the top and there dissolved, it is
a sign that the process is finished.’
