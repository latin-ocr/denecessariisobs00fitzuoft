14 INTRODUCTION

Domus Regis ¹ ’ (c. 1 135), and examine the organization revealed in
that difficult document; we shall compare it with the organization
of the Exchequer as given in the Dialogus, and thus show that, with
a few exceptions, every important officer in the financial depart-
ment has his place also in the household. It may be added, that the
constitution of the household is so clearly of Frankish origin that it
is not possible even to doubt that its organization was originally
imported from abroad ².

Before coming to the details of each office it is needful to make
a brief study of the financial department as a whole. The first
characteristic of it is its double nature. In it one office is super-
imposed upon another ; there is an upper Exchequer and a lower.
This lower Exchequer is concerned with the payment and receipt
of money, and at its head stood the Treasurer and Chamberlains,
to whom all writs dealing with these matters were addressed. The
actual work of the lower Exchequer was performed by deputies of
these Officers, but the responsibility was upon the Treasurer and
Chamberlains themselves. It is possible that the lower Exchequer
and the Treasury, which is closely connected with it, are the actual
successors of the Treasury of the Anglo-Saxon period3 at any rate,
its staff can be traced back to the Conquest.

The upper Exchequer was a court of account, of which the
Treasurer and Chamberlains were members‚ but which contained
many other officers having no connexion with the Treasury. It is
simply the king’s court for matters of finance. The king himself
might, and sometimes did, preside ³. Certain great officers always
sat there, but the king might order other persons to do so by his
special mandate. Like other courts, it had its records ; and, in
fact, the more we think of the Treasury as an office in the modern
sense, the nearer we shall be to comprehending its action 3 and the
more we think of the upper Exchequer as a court, the more nearly
right shall we be on that side.

First of the officers constituting the court came the Justiciar.
He appears simply as the king's representative, and as the head of
either the Curia Regis or the Exchequer in the king’s absence.
Robert, Earl of Leicester ⁴, and after him Richard de Lucy, held
this office during the first two-thirds of the reign of Henry 11.
