6 INTRODUCTION

Brz‘tz'slz Museum, MS. Harley 3887. Tabularius et Gervasi
Tilburiensis de necessariis Scaccarii observandis accurate et per-
bene digestis in duobus libris.

Brz‘tz'sh lfficseum, MS. Add. 11625. An imperfect MS„ con-
taining, however, the Index Rerum. Presented by Sir Henry Ellis.

Bodleian Lzbrmy, MS. Bodley 872, entitled ‘ Gervasius Tilburi-
ensis? 1647.

Bodleian Libram, MS. Rawlinson D. 349. On paper. Folio.
Seventeenth century.

Another division is headed by—

Lambetlz Lz'braty, MS. 138, Art. 5. A transcript made for
Sir Thomas Bromley by William Lambarde, A. D. 1572. We have
not examined this MS.

Of this there appear to be two copies:

Brz‘tz'slz Muscam, MS. Stowe 311. A folio on paper, of the end
of the sixteenth century.

Brz'tz'slz Museum, MS. Add. 25277. An abridgement from
Lambarde's transcript down to ‘ a murdris, scutagiis et a danegeldis ⁹
(1. viii. D).

There was also a MS. belonging to Sir Henry Spelman,
mentioned in H. Wanley's notes in the sale catalogue of his
library, which was put up to auction in 1709 (MS. Harl. 7055,
f. 2 3). This we have been unable to trace. Two transcripts of it
however exist, which refer to it as a MS. ‘optimae notae.’ An
examination of these proved it to have been derived from N.

These transcripts are—

Britz‘slz spluseum, MS. Stowe 312. A folio on paper, copied
A.D. 1646, for Sir Roger Twysden, with notes showing his know-
ledge of the authorship of the treatise.

Brz'tz'sh flsuseum, MS. Stowe 938. Apparently a later copy of
the same.

Other MSS. derived from N are: Brz'tc’slz Museum, MS. Add.
4786 (a Clarendon MS. seventeenth century) and Cambridge
Universz‘fy Lz'brarjy, Dd. 4. 46. Cambridge Unz'versz’ly Lzbrmy,
Ee. 2. 1 1 is a poor eclectic text from N and R.
