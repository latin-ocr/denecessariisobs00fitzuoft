obolus: cf. P. R. 10 Hen. 11, Southamplon‚ p. 28 ‘ et pro lumine ad
custodiendum thesaurum, roffi, this probably refers to some
treasure shipped to France.

P. 66,1. 22. proprietatibus . . . distinctaz being as it were
different species of the same genus, and the properties being in each
case consequent on the differentia. But the logical terminology is
used loosely‚ and should not be pressed.

l. 29. a scaccario transmarino: for a discussion of this
question see Introduction, pp. 13-43.

P. 67, 1. 3. Videtur annotantur. We have bracketed
this passage; first the statement made in it is entirely untrue ,· this
indeed by itself would not suffice to do more than suggest a sus·
picion of its genuineness. But in the second place it is impertinent
to the argument. The sense is as follows ς the Exchequer, it is
urged, must date from pre-Norman times because the oldest in-
habitants know all about blanch farm and what it means; granted
that they do, replies the author, this only shows that blanch farm
dates back to Saxon times, and does not bear on the antiquity
of the Exchequer. It is hardly likely that after thus disposing of
the argument he would go on to dispose of the perfectly true basis
of it by adducing an assertion concerning Domesday book which
the briefest glance at the volume must have refuted. Thirdly it
may be pointed out that ‘ vsus eius ' below is the institution of the
Exchequer‚ not of the blanch farm.

1. 11. inferius annotantur: i. e. below Ῑ. vii.

l. 14. Habet enim hoc. The distinction between the Curia
Regis and the Exchequer is gradually becoming complete during
the reign of Henry ΙΙ. Itis a distinction not of place—for the
judges of the curia often sat in scaccario (cf. P. R. 17 Hen. 11,
p. 73, Rolulus Curiae Regis, Pipe Roll Soc. vol. 14. p. 103), not
of persons—for the staff of the two courts was much the same—but
of function (cf. Introduction, p. 13). The Curia Regis was
concerned with law, the Exchequer with finance. Yet fines of
land were taken before the Exchequer and enrolled on the Pipe
Rolls (Braclon’s Note Book, ed. Maitland, case 10953 Madox,
Formulare Anglicanum, ccclvii), and in other ways the border
line is sometimes overstepped. Normally the king sat in person
in the Curia Regis, and was not present in the Exchequer. Yet the
young king Henry sat at the Exchequer at Westminster to hear
Becket’s account on his laying down his lay offices when elected to
