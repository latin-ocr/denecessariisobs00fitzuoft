30' INTRODUcrroN

No payment was made to the melter for repeating the test ¹, and
the test-picces, when done with, were put by to be used for making
silver plate‚ or for coinage for use abroad ².

Two serious difficulties arise in connexion with this account, and
throw grave doubts on its accuracy. In the first place, the only
mention of the use of lead is in the passage tgnz‘s scilicet ex estua-
tione vel plumbi z'ry‘usz'one3 and this passage, though supported by
all the MSS„ has the form of a gloss. Furthermore, it is very
difficult to understand ⁸. The use of an ash test, or cupel, instead
of an ordinary crucible, does indeed imply that lead was used 4 ; but¹
it seems clear that Richard the Treasurer had no idea of the reason
for its use, and consequently attached no importance to its presence.
He was, however, confessedly ignorant of metallurgy ⁵, and even
skilled metallurgists of a later date are inclined to regard the lead
as merely protecting the silver from volatilization ⁶. Moreover, the
test of the completion of the process quoted above is consonant
with the view that cupellation was employed, since it may well refer
to the phenomenon known as ‘brightening’ We may probably,
therefore, assume that the difficulties of the passage are solely due
to the ignorance of the author. In the second place, it will be
observed that the test-piece, as it leaves the melter's hands, is
assumed to be pure silver. Consequently, if the account in the
Dialogus were correct, blanch payments would have been made on
a pure silver basis ,· that is to say, the sheriff would only have been
credited with the weight of pure silver actually paid in. There is
no mention of any allowance being made for alloy.

Now the account of the origin of blanehing given in the
Dialogus⁷ implies that the process was intended only to guard
against wear of the coin, clipping, and false coining⁸ ; that is to say,
that the sheriff’s payment was reduced from its current value to its
value in standard silver. We must conclude that the author of the
Dialogus regarded the standard silver as being pure silver ⁹. It can,
however, be shown that this was not the case. Actual analysis of
the coins leads to the conclusion that the ‘old standard of England'
