to us. Our own view, which we put forward with some diffidence,
is that we ought to see in the T rz'columm's only the register-book
of Richard Fitz-Neal, in which he set down anything that interested
him. Such a book would probably remain in the Exchequer and
would there perish by use or neglect, as so many Exchequer registers
have perished. The chief difficulty of this view is the word ‘edidi '
in the first passage quoted above. But no view of the passages is
free from difficulty, and it is hard to suppose that this book was ever
published in the modem sense of the word. Probably ‘ edidi '
means little more than ‘ wrote, compiled‚' though ‘condidi' would
have been more natural in this sense.

It has been objected to this view that the Trz'columnz’s as
described seems to have been rather a literary than an official

composition. The ordinary type of official serap-book, it may be
readily granted, does not resemble the Trz'columnz's. But it may
fairly be urged that there is room for many books between the
extreme types of the finished chronicle and the casual note-book.
Our main contentiori is that the T ricolumm's was far removed from the
first of these3 but at the same time in care of selection, in orderli-
ness of arrangement, and even in literary style it may have been
far above the second. It cannot have been a continuous historical
narrative.

In attempting to estimate the credibility of the Dialogus de
scaccario, the persona] character, education‚ and career of the author
must not be lost sight of. In matters of history his own personal
evidence is no doubt good, e. g. when he quotes precedents for
Exchequer decisions. His other statements, when their origin
cannot be distinctly traced‚ have the value, or rather the worth-
lessness‚ of official tradition. They cannot be accepted without
corroboration, and sometimes where an independent test is applic-
able (as in his account of the compiling of Domesday Book) they
can be shown to have no near relation to the facts.

Again, in matters of actual practice the author’s position at the
Exchequer renders his evidence conclusive on points of daily
occurrence, but there are distinct traces of antiquarianism in his
descriptionS‚ and it is clear that he often describes the Exchequer
itself as it ought to have been rather than as it was. The list of
Officers present, for instance, must have shown considerable gaps
on many occasions. Where he admittedly digresses beyond his
own sphere his evidence, though valuable, must be received with
