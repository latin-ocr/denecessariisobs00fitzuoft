174 DE SCACCAmo

P. 70,1. 21. in serie scanni, ‘in the row on the bench, but

a place was assigned to him behind on a higher level.¹
1. 25. oculi lincei: cf. Hor. S. Ι, ii. 90 ‘Lyncei Con-
templere oculis.'

P. 71, l. 10. per suppositam personam: i. e. the clerk of
the chancellor, who acts as the deputy of the chancellor ; cf. below,
I. vi. c.

1. 23. auotoritas illius, ‘for the authority of the third roll is
equal to the two others '3 the usual reading ‘illis ' is a blunder.

l. 34. retractis. ‘Retracte¹ are apparently arrears of pay.
Cf. P. R. 17 Hen. 11 (1171), p. 34, Honour qf William Fitz Alan.
Here Guy l’Estrange the sheriff has been allowed >830 85. 4d.
for the pay of twenty serjeants at Oswestry for a year at rd.
a day. At the end of his account are the words ‘Idem vicecomes
debet 745. de Retracta liberationis Servientum de Blancmuster.'
That is to say he had kept back so much of the sum allowed and
was therefore accountable for it at the Exehequer. The sum was
paid into the Treasury in the 18th year.

P. 72, l. 5. Notandum vero . . . non. We have bracketed
this passage for the following reasons; the use of nolandum
without estis suspicious ; the sentence is out of place and should
come in the section on the marshal3 and lastly it is unintelligible
as it stands here. In the year 1377 we find that the constable
and the marshal claimed 4d. in the ἒ. on the wages os all men-at-
arms, excepting seneschals and chamberlains. The distinction
in the present passage between garrison troops and troops in the
field is not mentioned. Cf. J. H. Round, Commune <ff London,
pp. 302 sqq.; Spelman, Glossarium, s.v. Marescallus.

l. 12. idem velle et idem nollet cf. Sallust, Catilina, xx.
‘ Nam idem velle atque idem nolle ea demum firma amicitia est' ;
which is possibly borrowed from Demosthenes, De Corona, 32 3. 7
ταύτὰ λυπεῖσθαι καὶ ταύτὰ χαίρειν.

1. 25. singulis eomitatibus . . . ministrari. Madox (H. E.
c. xxiv. ξ 6. n. (l), p. 727) quotes from the Pipe Roll of 10 Ric. 1,
Rot. 4. b. Lt'nc. ‘ attulit cartam ipsius Aaron . . . quae est in forulo
marescalli in Lincollscira.’ In the reign of Edward I a file or
a bag seems to have been more usual. (Madox, ibid. p. 728.)
The rolls from which the ‘ Testa de Nevill' was drawn up are
however, as we have said above, frequently referred to on the
Memoranda Rolls of Edward 1 as being ‘in forulis Marescalli.’
