196 DE SCACCARIO

term 3 cf. Spelman, Gloss. s.V. ‘ Drenches']. Cf. Stubbs, Constilulz'onal
Hz‘slory (1891) 1. 281 nn„ Pollock and Maitland, Hz'st. English Lazo,
Ι. 372 sq„ 381. For the general questions raised by the two
passages, cf. Maidand, Domesday and Beyond3 Vinogradoff,
Vz'llez'nage in England.

P. 101, l. 10. hoe . . . iudiciario. The ‘titulus de libro iudi-
ciario' is chapter xvi below, whereas that on ‘centuriata, etc.' is
chapter xvii. The use of the word ‘titulus' does not necessarily
imply any formal division into chapters; but there can be little
doubt that the words bracketed are only a gloss.

1. 13. Insula nostra sujs, etc. Cf. John of Salisbury, Pol.
VIII. vii. (734, B, Migne) ‘ Defluxit ergo in insulam opulentam, et
quae fere sola bonis suis est in orbe contenta, quidquid magnifi-
centiae imo luxuriae potuit inueniri! Cf. also ‘Commendatio
Britannie' printed in Ralph de Diceto, Opera Ι. 10. (Rolls Series)
‘Britannia sicut legitur inter insulas omnes est vel prima vel
maxima3 quam natura benignior adeo reddidit ad inhabitandum
acceptam vt quicquid vsus desiderat vel appetit luxus, ex ea pro-
ueniat aut aliunde transuehatur ad eam.’ The verses are probably
the author's own.

1. 17. Furem preciosa signata sollicitant. Cf. Seneca,
Epist. 68. ξ 4 ‘ Furem signata sollicitant.’

1. 21. fugas aggrediebantur equoreas. Professor Lieber-
mann (Ez'nleilung‚ 3 1 note 7) considers this a reminiscence of Vergil.
We have not identified the passage.

l. 2 5. aliquid . . . historia. The reference is to the
mythical king Danus, in whose right the Danes claimed the island
of Britain; since, while the British kings held of the Emperor,
Danus held of God only: see Gaimar, L' Hzlrloz're des Engles, vv.
208 sqq., 4317 sqq. Prof. Liebermann suggests that the book
quoted may be Gaimar or the source from which both Gaimar
and Geoffrey of Monmouth drew. If not, he is inclined to regard
the passage as merely referring to the fact of the Danish invasions,
and compares the Introduction to Henry of Huntingdon’s fifth book.
(Ez'nl. pp. 102, 103). Of these three suggestions the second seems
the more probable. ‘ Danus ' was of course familiar to Scandina·
vian annalists (e. g. Saxo Grammaticus) at this date.

l. 27. Ad hos igitur arcendos. The account of the Α. S.
Chronz'cle anno 991 is that the original object was to buy off the
Danes. The account in the Dialogus is no doubt copied from
