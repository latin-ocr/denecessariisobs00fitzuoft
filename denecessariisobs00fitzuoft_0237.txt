NOTES 173

Here the stock from which the tally was split and with which it
had to be verified. In case a tally was lost the stock would be
evidence to warrant the striking of a new one, and hence might
be regarded as a quittance. It answers to the counterfoil of
a modern receipt form.

Ρ.69,1. 22. Wintonjensis episeopus: i.e.Richard0f11chester.
For his life see D. N. B. : cf. Introduction, p. 26.

l. 23. archidiaconus ex officio. Madox’s reading ‘ non ex
officio’ is due to a misunderstanding of the text of R. That the
archdeacon held a regular office in the Exchequer appears from
1. v. O below, where his office is described3 cf. also 1. vi. F ‘sic
habes omniurn qui ad maius scaccarium ex officio resident iura
distincta,’ where ‘ omnium ' clearly includes the archdeacon.

1. 24. ex nouella constitutione, i. e. since the accession of
Henry II: cf. I. v. B, ΙΙ. i. C, below, ‘novella constitutio': the
term is clearly borrowed from the ‘ Novellae Constitutiones' of
Civil Law.

P. 70, 1. 4. magister Thomas cognomento Brunus. A
fuller account of Thomas is given in Ι. vi. E, below. He was an
Englishman in the service of Roger II of Sicily, and is described
in various charters of that king from 1137 onwards as ‘ magister
Thomas capellanus ' or ‘familiaris Regis‚' and in a Greek charter
as Θωμᾶ τοῦ Βρούνου. He left Sicily soon after the accession of
William the Wicked in 1154. He may possibly have arrived in
England in 1158, as Ralph his nephew received 4d. a day out of
the farm of Herefordshire for that year and the next. If so, he is
probably the ‘ Thomas clericus ’ who received a palfrey out of the
farm os London in 1158. In 1160 he received 5d. a day from the
farm of Hereford‚ and was still receiving it in 1175. Besides this,
he received :842 145. as wages in 1160. In 1165 he became the
King's Almoner, a post which he continued to hold in 1175. In
1169 he paid 55. 8d. for a purpresture‚ having apparently built
four houses in Hereford: he was still paying rent for this in 1175.
[See Pipe Roll. Soc. and article sub nom. Thomas in D. N. B.]
Thomas died before 1189, as his pension from Hereford was not
paid in that year, and his property, consisting of some houses
outside Hereford and a parcel of land in Winchester, was in
the king's hands. (P. R. 1 Ric. Ι.)

l. 6. funiculus . . . soluitur: cf. Eccles. iv, 12 ‘Funiculus
triplex difficile rumpitur!
